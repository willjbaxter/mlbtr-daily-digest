We‚Äôll get things started in a minute or two after the questions start to pile up‚Ä¶.</p>
<p><strong>Dave:</strong> Update on G Stone and R Ryan for Dodgers for beginning of 26</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Definitely the top question on Dodgers fans‚Äô mind as the NLCS begins.  üôÇBoth should be on track to be ready for the start of Spring Training.  It doesn‚Äôt appear either pitcher has had any setbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Julio:</strong> Can my team beat the mighty canadiens</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Mariners would definitely beat the Montreal Canadiens in a baseball game.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Cutter:</strong> Will the royals Sign Yaz back .</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> A reunion would make a lot of sense.  KC desperately needs outfield help, and Yaz played really well for them in a brief spell.  While it‚Äôs safe to assume Yaz wouldn‚Äôt keep up those numbers over a full season, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt the Royals to sign him to a relatively inexpensive one-year deal as just a part-timer, if necessary</p>
<p><strong>NY Mess:</strong> Pete wants 7 years. Five seems too long. What is realistic?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> I think he‚Äôll get five years.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine any team giving Alonso seven years, and that might‚Äôve just been an aim-high negotiating tactic that will eventually get reduced to a more manageable number.</p>
<p><strong>Angela:</strong> Want do you see the phillies  doing this off-season</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> I‚Äôm slated to write the Phillies offseason outlook piece, so stay tuned on that front.  But broadly speaking, I think they need to shake things up as much as they can with the roster.  That means doing all they can to retain Schwarber, but parting ways with Bohm, Stott, Castellanos, and maybe Realmuto.  (The latter one I‚Äôm more lukewarm about, since JTR walks, the Phils then have to find another catcher somewhere.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael King:</strong> Should I opt in with the Padres after the season I just had?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> I assume by ‚Äúopt in‚Äù you mean accept a qualifying offer, since there‚Äôs no scenario where King and the Padres both trigger the mutual option. Assuming the mutual option is declined and the Padres issue the QO, I think there‚Äôs a more than decent chance King accepts.  He‚Äôll still draw plenty of interest on the open market, but with his injury-riddled 2025 hanging over his head, he might prefer a QO in a familiar locale than rolling the dice on a short-term opt-out laden deal (or a one-year pillow deal) on a new team entirely</p>
<p><strong>Brady:</strong> Who will be the Phillies opening day third baseman?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> As noted earlier, I think they‚Äôll non-tender Bohm.  Maybe they find a trade partner before the non-tender deadline, but after last winter, I think teams realize the Phillies are ready to move on from Bohm and will just wait until he‚Äôs cut.As for who might take over, 3B is a less difficult position to fill than catcher, but obviously losing Bohm opens up another hole in the lineup.  Bregman would be a mighty interesting possibility if he doesn‚Äôt work out an extension with Boston.  Arenado is probably a no-go due to his decline over the last couple of years. On the trade front, I feel I‚Äôll be saying this about a lot of teams, but Brendan Donovan would be a very good fit in Philly</p>
<p><strong>White Sox Fan:</strong> Is there any value in picking up Luis Robert‚Äôs option and trying to trade him?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The White Sox are kind of damned if they do, damned if they don‚Äôt.  Exercise the option, and they‚Äôll still have difficulty finding a trade.  Decline the option and Robert just walks for nothing, apart from some meaningless payroll savings</p>
<p><strong>World Series Bound:</strong> Chances of a MIL/SEA world series coming soon?</p>
<p><strong>World Series:</strong> Dream matchup of remaining teams? M‚Äôs Brewers would be wild given M‚Äôs have never been and Brewers have never won.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> As a Blue Jays fan, I‚Äôm not exactly keen on the Mariners winning the pennant, hahaBut if the Jays had to lose, a Mariners/Brewers WS would indeed be a lot of fun. Off the top of my head, I think 1980 (Phillies/Royals) was the last time there was a World Series between two teams seeking their first ring?</p>
