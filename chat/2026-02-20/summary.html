Anthony and I flipped the Monday/Friday chats this week since I was off for the holiday, so you&#x27;re stuck with me today. Apologies in advance!We&#x27;ll get going around 3pm CT, but feel free to submit a question(s) ahead of time if you prefer! We&#x27;ll get started a few minutes early today and go til a bit after 4</p>
<p><strong>BaseballRadio:</strong> Curious as to how the Cleveland Ownership can justify doing literally nothing to upgrade the offense, while dropping to around 70 million in payroll, pending the Clase/Ortiz situation… literally dead last in MLB ?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> It&#x27;s pretty inexplicable. The only significant move they made this winter was extending Ramirez on a deal that saved them $10MM in 2026. They re-signed Austin Hedges and bought a few cheap, one-year relievers.For me, they had far and away the worst offseason in baseball. There are so many glaring holes in that lineup, and they&#x27;re content to just hope a club that produced an AL-worst .226/.296/.373 batting line (87 wRC+) will become serviceable from an offensive standpoint based solely on in-house improvement and promotions of Bazzana, DeLauter, etc. It&#x27;s an indefensible offseason, and if I were a Cleveland fan, I&#x27;d be livid. I joked the other day with colleagues that maybe the Dolans are trying to force people to say &quot;Look! See how badly MLB needs a floor!&quot; ... and while I was mostly kidding, I wonder whether there&#x27;s some partial truth to that sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Now that Pablo Lopez is out any chance the Twins listen to offers for Byron Buxton?</p>
<p><strong>J. Zoll:</strong> So . . . a lot of Twins fans think trading Joe Ryan ASAP is the right thing to do in the wake of Pablo Lopez&#x27;s need for TJ. This late in the winter, though, I&#x27;m wondering if a guy couldn&#x27;t get more of a return closer to the deadline. Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong> Hey Steve, thanks as always for the chat! What avenue do you see the Twins taking to address the Pablo replacement while he recovers? Sign Giolito/Littell/Scherzer/another FA, acquire a seasoned innings eater via trade, or work with what they have?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Lots and lots of Twins questions post-Pablo For starters, no they&#x27;re not going to trade Ryan now. Demand is down -- though teams would still want him -- and Tom Pohlad has done nothing but talk about how he wants to be aggressive and win now since he took over the executive chair position. They&#x27;re not going to be good (unless about 15 different things break their way), but it&#x27;s pretty hard for an owner to pull that kind of about-face when his whole schtick so far has been &quot;I&#x27;m going to be accountable, answer tough questions and win back the fans.&quot;I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen, but I don&#x27;t see any way they trade Ryan before Opening Day. Deadline? Sure. But not before then. Ditto Buxton on all that I do think there&#x27;s a realistic chance the Twins give a one-year deal to Giolito or Littell. I guess they could throw a year at Tyler Anderson to bring in some cheaper, fairly durable innings as well.There aren&#x27;t many teams left with much budget space, but the Twins made a late run at Framber Valdez, so Pohlad clearly isn&#x27;t married to the payroll staying at its $108MM-ish current level. It wouldn&#x27;t be exciting, but his comments keep saying he wants to show the fans they&#x27;ll try and be aggressive under his watch, well ... Gio/Littell is about the closest he can come at this point. Even before the report on the Jays/Scherzer picking up talks, there was no way Max was signing in Minnesota. He wants a clear win-now contender.</p>
<p><strong>Tribefan528:</strong> Is it inevitable that Agustin Ramirez moves to 1B? How does his bat project at dh/1b?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Guys make crazy improvements all the time, but Ramirez would need seismic gains behind the plate to stay at catcher. He had one of the worst defensive seasons ever for a catcher... -14 DRS and -12 FRV per Statcast -- in only 605 innings!Even if you don&#x27;t like/trust modern metrics, he had an 8.8% caught-stealing rate and allowed NINETEEN passed balls in 605 frames. Plus 36 wild pitches! He has enough power to be a 1B/DH, but he undercuts that power by chasing too much ... if you&#x27;re going to be a RH 1B/DH, you need more than a 6% walk rate. He&#x27;s only 24, but last season was pretty rough in all aspects, other than ripping 21 homers in 536 PAs.</p>
<p><strong>john:</strong> Why has Giolito to Atl not happened yet?</p>
