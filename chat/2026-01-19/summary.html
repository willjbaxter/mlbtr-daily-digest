We’ll open up the question bag in a minute, so get your comments in…</p>
<p><strong>Brett:</strong> Freddy Peralta for River Ryan and Eduardo Quintero.  Who says no?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Brewers, without hesitation</p>
<p><strong>Jed Hoyer:</strong> Matt Shaw to St. Louis for Brendan Donovan. Who says no?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Cubs, since I think they value Shaw more highly than two years of Donovan.  Also, the chances of a Chicago/St. Louis trade of this magnitude are very, very low.</p>
<p><strong>Preller:</strong> Am I going to surprise people with a free agent strike? Maybe framber with opt outs?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> This seems like a possibility, but then again, it seemed like Suarez was perhaps heading into short-term/opt-out territory until he landed that deal from Boston that beat expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Yankees:</strong> What was it about the Yankees that they didn’t make an all-out push to sign Imai?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> They just didn’t value him that highly?  Probably just as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Dan S.:</strong> Most likely to move: Peralta, Gore, Lodolo or Bubic?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Just my two cents, but from most to least, I’d rank them Bubic, Peralta, Gore, Lodolo.The Reds’ rotation is such their bread-and-butter that I don’t see them moving any of their big three.  Gore is probably staying put this offseason, but the trade deadline could be a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Jagger:</strong> Do you think the Reds trade Brady Singer? he’s only under contract for 1 more season before hitting FA. I would think the Reds would like to get something in return for him.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> He has long seemed like the most logical Reds starter to be on the move, but no deal to date.  Doesn’t mean a trade couldn’t still happen in the next few weeks, but it’d be interesting to see what kind of significant bat (if any) the Reds could acquire for one season of a solid starter but one who probably projects as a back-end starter on a good team In general, Singer isn’t the type of pitcher who’s a lock to start a playoff game.  Teams are only willing to give up so much for such a player.</p>
<p><strong>Cj james:</strong> Braves are unlucky again with Kim. They will have to get someone else right</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Not necessarily, since Dubon can fill in on a temporary basis.  Kim’s recovery timeline of 4-5 months is broad enough that if he’s “only” going to be out until mid-May, Atlanta might just roll with Dubon until then at shortstop.  But, the Braves will likely pick up a veteran backup infielder type heading into spring training</p>
<p><strong>Stafford:</strong> Why aren’t more teams tanking/rebuilding with the lack of parity in MLB.  Specifically the Angels…they can’t even outspend their problems!</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Over the last three seasons, 22 of MLB’s 30 teams have made the playoffs at least once.  There’s plenty of parity.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Atkins:</strong> Do I have any interest in a Brendon Donovan/ Jojo Romero sweap</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Both would fit in Toronto, but the Jays have enough utility infield types that Donovan probably isn’t a priority (and especially not at the Cardinals’ asking price).  Romero would be the better fit of the two.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Wilbur wood passed.  I saw him pitch for the seattle rainier.  He had a nice mlb career.  He pitched 300 innings plus a number of times.  Will we ever see a pitcher get 300 innings again?  I was 9 when I saw him in the old six stadium</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #999; font-style: italic;">... and 119 more exchanges</p></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><a href="../../index.html">← Back to All Posts</a><a href="#">Top ↑</a></div></div></body></html>
