Let’s open up the queue to see what’s what…</p>
<p><strong>Charkip:</strong> Who says no, Jordan Lawlar to the Guardians and Chase DeLauter to the DBacks</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Probably both teams, but Cleveland moreso.</p>
<p><strong>Tigers Fan:</strong> Why haven’t we heard any talk about the Tigers trying to extend Casey Mize?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It could be that these talks are happening and both sides are staying quiet, but Mize is something of a tricky player to evaluate for extension purposes.  He’s only had a couple of (mostly) healthy seasons and pitched well, but not necessarily front-of-the-rotation well.I’m sure Mize feels like he can hit another level, and hitting that level in 2026 lines him up nicely in free agency next winter.  So he might not want to lock himself down to an extension now.</p>
<p><strong>Guest:</strong> Bellinger will get more or less than Bregman?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> I probably shouldn’t doubt Boras’ ability to work his magic, but I think it’ll be less</p>
<p><strong>Squints:</strong> As a Brewers fan, is there any rebuttal to the Cubs recent moves?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Brewers aren’t ever going to outspend the Cubs, but that hasn’t stopped Milwaukee from beating them in the past.  I’m not sure I’d necessarily even pick Chicago for first in the Central right now.</p>
<p><strong>Scott S:</strong> What type of package should the Brewers receive from a Freddy Peralta trade? Which teams seem to be most interested?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Peralta is so inexpensive that pretty much any contender in the league would or should want him.The most popular comp for a Peralta trade package is the Corbin Burnes package: a MLB-ready position player, an MLB-ready pitcher, and a draft pick (or another minor leaguer, if the Brewers are dealing with a team that doesn’t have a tradeable Competitive Balance Pick). Given how Peralta is also making a little more than half of Burnes’ salary in his final arb-eligible season, the Brewers may well ask for more in a trade return.</p>
<p><strong>Bregman:</strong> Think the Cubs will do the Red Sox a solid and trade Hoerner to Boston?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Bregman signing makes a Nico trade slightly more likely, but if I’m the Cubs, I keep everyone for the sake of depth.  Injuries are inevitable, and there are worse ideas than having Moises/Shaw/Alcantara as the all-younger bench core.</p>
<p><strong>I got friends in Lowe places:</strong> Any thoughts on where Nathanial Lowe lands?</p>
<p><strong>hiflew:</strong> Any rumblings about the Rockies plans at 1B?  Is the plan to hope for Charlie Condon to win the job in the spring?  They only have Blaine Crim otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Hey, two questions in one fell swoop!  Lowe’s list of potential landing spots is pretty thin, but a one-year deal in Colorado seems like as decent a spot as any.  Condon has only 55 Double-A games under his belt, so an Opening Day job seems a little unlikely.  The Rockies should be as patient as possible with Condon.</p>
<p><strong>Framber &amp; Ranger:</strong> When and where are we finally going to sign?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> This is a purely speculative pipe dream of mine, but I wonder if the Marlins could be a dark horse for either of these guys.  Miami can add another frontline starter to replace Cabrera, and boost the payroll enough to avoid an MLBPA grievance.But, in a more realistic world, the Orioles make a lot of sense for either guy.  Can’t rule out the Mets, maybe the Padres if they move some money, maybe even the Yankees or Red Sox.</p>
<p><strong>Bo:</strong> Bichette to Phillies seems like a SOLID fit</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’s not a perfect fit since it then essentially means the Phils have to move Bohm or Stott.  But, since Bichette is also way better than either of these guys, you’re right.</p>
