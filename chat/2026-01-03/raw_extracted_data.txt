SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Earlier edition of The Weekend Chat this time, but hopefully with no shortage of questions and hot takes filing in from our readers.  Let’s see what’s up….

====================

SPEAKER: Luca
---
Are the Rays still in on Ketel Marte? Anyone else there targeting?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
In all likelihood, the Rays are targeting players much less expensive than Marte.  He’d be a huge help for their lineup, of course, but with a remaining price tag that wouldn’t seem to fit Tampa’s budget.Hindsight being 50-50, if the Rays had exercised Fairbanks’ option, I wonder if he might’ve been part of a hypothetical Marte trade package — both as salary offset, and because Arizona needs ninth-inning help

====================

SPEAKER: Kwallington
---
Has the Cardinals trade stuff stalled? It’s been a while since any updates.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not surprising that things slowed down over the holidays.  The Cards have already moved Gray and Contreras, leaving Arenado as the last big contract remaining, and Donovan/JoJo/maybe Gorman or Nootbaar as less-expensive but more sought-after trade chips. The Cardinals certainly aren’t done with their swaps yet, and it feels like Donovan, Romero, and Arenado will all be elsewhere by Opening Day

====================

SPEAKER: Cj james
---
The Braves should worry about the bullpen more than the starters. Do you agree?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Probably, though Suarez and the re-signed Iglesias solve a couple of big question marks.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve
---
Who is more likely to be in a different uniform next year, Duran or Casas?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Casas

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Who signs first?Ranger Suarez(51.3% | 641 votes)Framber Valdez(48.6% | 607 votes)Total Votes: 1248

====================

SPEAKER: secret souse
---
What is the easiest path for Red Sox to dump money

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Their projected payroll is $191.1MM, and their tax number is around $240MM.  Not huge figures considering this is the Red Sox we’re talking about, so my answer is “they don’t need to dump money to make any further notable moves.”However, it seems ownership feels differently.  The easiest path in terms of pure simplicity is to attach a prospect (either a pitcher or Casas) to Yoshida or Hicks, perhaps to a team like Colorado that needs all the young help it can get.  But, clubs are increasingly loath to give away young talent as sweeteners in salary dumps.

====================

SPEAKER: RedsHopeful
---
What’s stopping the Reds from being in on Okamoto?  Seems like a great fit at 1B/DH along with Sal Stewart and have Steer as super utility again?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Good question. Maybe they are in on him, and this’ll be another outta-nowhere signing like Murakami to the ChiSox and Imai to Houston

====================

SPEAKER: Matt
---
Okamoto going to sign during the chat?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Don’t jinx it!

====================

SPEAKER: Norbert
---
Are you concerned with Ranger Suarez’s loss of velocity, or do you think he has the type of command that will allow him to continue getting weak contact for a few more years?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think I’m higher on most on Suarez, since in my view, he was the clear choice as the best starter on this year’s FA market. He wasn’t exactly a high-velo guy to begin with, so a drop shouldn’t (in theory) impact his bread and butter abilities of generating grounders and soft contact.

====================

SPEAKER: Peralta
---
The rumor mill quieted on Peralta. You think that picks back up now that the holidays are over or do you think the Brewers are more likely to give the season a go with him?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It always felt likelier that Milwaukee would just keep Peralta, since they’d need a ton in return to say yes to a trade.  It could be things get rolling a bit now that Imai is off the board, though it’s interesting to remember that the Astros were one of the teams reportedly interested in Peralta.  That may no longer be the case now that Imai and Burrows are on board.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Why is no one talking about Okamoto to the Yankees?  He could platoon at 1st or 3rd and releve Domingues in rig,ht.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Okamoto himself probably wants to be more than a short-side platoon guy

====================

SPEAKER: Josh
---
Do you see Ian Happ starting for the cubs this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Yes.  He had a no-trade clause, so he probably isn’t going anywhere.

====================

SPEAKER: NY Sports
---
Any chance that a potential lockout for next year lowered the projected salary for Imai, Murakami and potentially Okamoto?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I don’t think it’s the looming lockout, necessarily, but more that this trio had more question marks than a lot of other premium players recently coming over from NPB.

====================

SPEAKER: Imai
---
What are your thoughts on the Astros signing Imai? Was it a good signing to help fortify their rotation?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I like the deal a lot.  Potentially it’s a great bargain for the Astros, and if Imai pitches well, it’s just a one-year commitment since he would likely opt out next winter.Potentially, if Imai pitched well but not spectacularly well, he might also pass on his first opt-out just to avoid getting caught in limbo during a lockout

====================

SPEAKER: Ryan
---
Is Emerson plus a lottery ticket for Donovan possible. Donovan is what the Mariners would hope Emerson could be.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Zero chance Emerson is traded.  He’s a top-10 prospect in baseball.

====================

SPEAKER: Josh
---
Are the A’s contenders this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They need to do a lot more with their rotation before I can take them seriously as playoff candidates

====================

SPEAKER: Kyle
---
Are you surprised that Gore hasn’t been traded? Will the Nats have to pair him with Abrams or Wood to get the sort of return they were hoping for?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not terribly surprised.  This is another case where the Nationals don’t have to make a move right now, since Gore is controlled through 2028.  If another team stepped up with a huge offer, the Nats wouldn’t hesitate to deal Gore, but only in that circumstance.And Gore has more than enough value on his own that he wouldn’t need to be linked to another big trade chip.  And, needless to say, Wood isn’t going anywhere.

====================

SPEAKER: Alex
---
Does Z Gallen fit into the braves “ace caliber” – final need?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Gallen’s rough 2025 season dips him out of the ace category, though he has shown ace-type stuff in the past.  That might be enough to get the Braves to roll the dice, especially if Gallen is open to a somewhat shorter-term deal to re-establish his market.Two more obstacles…..Gallen would cost Atlanta a draft pick, since he rejected a qualifying offer.  Gallen is also a Boras client, and Anthopoulos traditionally doesn’t do a lot of business with Boras.

====================

SPEAKER: Bob Nutting
---
Are the Pirates wild card contenders if they get Okamoto or Suarez for 3B with that rotation?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’d say so.  Their lineup would be a lot better and the pitching is still strong, so that might be enough for Pittsburgh to get over the playoff line amidst a number of NL teams with comparable weaknesses

====================

SPEAKER: Polar Bear
---
The Mets are going to make some kind of move for a starting pitcher….right?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Sure, except it is becoming increasingly unclear if it’ll be the kind of frontline arm they need.

====================

SPEAKER: Pat
---
Whether it be a trade forna player like Kwan or signing a big bat, do you think the Dodgers will add an OF before the season starts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
A trade (though probably not for Kwan specifically) is more likely than a big signing, but maybe I shouldn’t write that while Tucker is still available.Some level of longer-term outfield help might be less feasible since LA doesn’t want to block its younger outfielders on the way up.

====================

SPEAKER: Ateam
---
Dodgers have a lot of young arms coming back from injury. What are the next steps? Stash them in the minors or trades?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Minor league stashing seems logical, as teams likely aren’t eager to give up a big return for pitchers just coming off long IL stints.  The Dodgers themselves probably want time to monitor these hurlers to evaluate their health, and to further gauge which ones they want to keep and which ones they might want to shop. Don’t forget, the Dodgers have needed all the rotation depth they can find over the last few years.  The team can also just stand pat.

====================

SPEAKER: Hot trade
---
Gunnar Henderson for Joe Ryan.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That would indeed be hot, but the O’s are never trading Henderson for two years of Ryan

====================

SPEAKER: Ken
---
Gore is only controlled through 2027.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Correct, that was a typo on my part.  But, two years of control is still a lot of time for Washington to explore trades.

====================

SPEAKER: Lance
---
Hi Mark. Thanks for doing the chat today.Which free agent signed so far, do you believe, will have the most positive impact for their new team?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Since you specified ’new’ team, does that mean you’re asking about just the free agents who went elsewhere?  That narrows the field by quite a bit, given how many FAs stayed put.Feels like Alonso will take to Camden Yards like a duck to water.  But, as a Jays fan, I’m hoping the answer is that Cease helps lead Toronto to a championship

====================

SPEAKER: Frustrated Nats Fan
---
How long do we have to wait to become even a fringe contender?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I wouldn’t have been surprised if the Nationals had been borderline contenders in 2025, yet things obviously went in the exact opposite direction.Seems like it’ll be at least two more seasons in the wilderness, though stranger things have happened in terms of unexpected turn-arounds.

====================

SPEAKER: steve
---
Kristin Campbell was the minor league player of the year .  If one looks at the list of players who have won previously –you see a very successful group.   Why has everyone given up on campbell.    Has Boston mismanaged him?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Sox certainly aren’t giving up on a player they’ve already signed to a hefty extension.  Fans can be a little too fickle when top prospects struggle early, even though the majority of top prospects routinely look shaky in their first time at the MLB level.  It would surprise nobody if Campbell suddenly broke out in 2026.

====================

SPEAKER: RoyalsCenter2026
---
The Royals have been super quiet after being involved in so many rumors? Will it heat back up and will they get a big of bat or are they done?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Doubt they’re done, since they need another good hitter in that lineup

====================

SPEAKER: Brockmire
---
What’s your take on the looming CBA quagmire?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think it’s a shame that a lockout seems to be a foregone conclusion, and that the two sides seem fine with things reaching that point.  In a perfect world, you’d have the two sides say “look, we’re both making a lot of money here, so let’s start figuring things out now to keep everyone happy.”

====================

SPEAKER: Carrie Halas
---
Were the Phillies genuinely in on Imai? If they wanted rotation depth that badly, why not pivot to Ranger?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s possible they might indeed consider reuniting with Suarez now that Imai is off the board.That said, it’s a little telling that there has been virtually no buzz about Suarez re-signing in Philly.  The team was publicly open about their desire to being back Schwarber and Realmuto, yet it was little more than boilerplate stuff in regards to Suarez.

====================

SPEAKER: Brother
---
James Wood looks like a bust and the Nationals should sell while his value is still high, any thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Wood strikes out way too much, and his bat really cooled off in the second half.He also has a 125 wRC+ and 40 homers in his first 1025 PA in the majors.  Wood isn’t going anywhere, and is still a huge building block for Washington

====================

SPEAKER: NY Sports
---
Would you say the off season has been quiet so far? It seems like there’s still a lot of players unsigned with roughly 6 weeks before catchers and pitchers report to spring training.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Six weeks is a lot of time.  Looking MLBTR’s top 50 as a guide, 29 of those 50 free agents have already signed, so there’s been a fair bit of movement even if a few of those guys were early-offseason qualifying offer accepting-types.

====================

SPEAKER: JeffyM
---
if the Jays are able to get Bo, Tucker or Bregman, do Straw or Lukes have any trade value or are they more DFA candidates?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If they get Tucker specifically, Lukes is probably traded.  Straw sticks around in any scenario as a backup OF.

====================

SPEAKER: CJ J
---
The Cubs seem to be sniffing around INFs.  If they sign one, who is the odd man out?  I have terrible feeling it’s Hoerner, even though he brings elite contact to a lineup that needs it.  Any chance, if the Cubs sign a Bregman or whomever, that Shaw is the odd man out and they could trade him for pitching?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Nico makes a ton of contact but it isn’t exactly quality contact.  He is also a free agent after the season, so it would make sense that the Cubs are looking to deal him now if Nico isn’t part of their future plans. That either opens up 2B for an acquisition, or perhaps they get Bregman and move Shaw to 2B

====================

SPEAKER: Cris E
---
Does COL burn things down this winter or get some front office stuff settled first and move the vets at the break?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Rockies don’t have many veterans left, and not much left in general for a fire sale.  Hard to have a teardown when the house has already burned to the ground, as they say.  (Or did I make that saying up?)I suspect DePodesta is viewing 2026 as an evaluation year, though naturally he’ll be open to any and all trade offers in the name of bringing younger talent into the organization.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Is Carson Benge the real deal and should he start opening day in center?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s a lot to like about Benge’s potential but breaking camp seems like a reach.  He has only 24 Triple-A games on his resume and he didn’t hit well in Syracuse, so it feels like some more seasoning is required.  However, he is a lock to make his MLB debut in 2026, and if he gets on an early tear in Triple-A, the Mets could make him a quick call-up

====================

SPEAKER: Daniel
---
Why do players wait so long to sign. If it was me I’d sign as soon as possible to get acclimated with my new squad.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If the offers aren’t interesting, players aren’t just going to grab the least-uninteresting lowball offer just for the sake of signing

====================

SPEAKER: Dana Brown’s a rental
---
Yordan Alvarez has a 1.046 career OPS as a LF (896 PAs) and .919 as a DH.  Why can’t the Astros just home Paredes the everyday DH and 1B/3B backup?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The issue isn’t whether or not Alvarez can hit as an outfielder, it’s whether he can stay healthy in regular outfield duty.  And, he isn’t a good defensive player.

====================

SPEAKER: Pete C
---
How do forecast the 2026 season for Rangers OF Evan Carter

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
First things first, Carter has to stay healthy.  That gives the Rangers a clear chance to evaluate a player who can still be a huge part of their future.

====================

SPEAKER: Radhippo
---
Okamoto and Gallen enough to get the Angels in the playoffs??

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’d take a lot more than that

====================

SPEAKER: Mr Red Leg
---
What would the Reds have to give up for Yandy Diaz?  Chase Petty?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
2026 is Diaz’s final guaranteed year, plus there’s a club option for 2027.  So two seasons of Diaz for Petty probably isn’t something Cincinnati is open to doing, though these could be elements of a multi-player swap

====================

SPEAKER: Jake K
---
Rockies need to make some movements…Coby Mayo seems like a perfect fit considering the surplus of infielders on the O’s and the power upside….would love to see him in Coors

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That probably doesn’t happen outside of a three-team trade, since I don’t think the Orioles would be willing to move Mayo for anyone in the Rockies’ organization

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Is boras the major problem to why the market is being held up?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As much as Boras usually has his clients wait on the market, this isn’t an absolute rule.  This winter alone, Cease was off the board very quickly.

====================

SPEAKER: Blue Heaven
---
Dodgers said Sasaki will be in rotation in 2026. But if Stone and/or River Ryan outperforms in ST, should they add one of them to rotation, and move Sasaki to BP at least for early in the season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As noted earlier, the Dodgers’ rotation has been constantly racked by injuries. So it’s possible a logjam just never really develops because at least one pitcher or another is on the IL.

====================

SPEAKER: Pizza pizza
---
Tigers look like they aren’t going to move the needle with the lineup with a signing/trade. McGonigle will be with the big club at some point this season. Why not look at signing him to a pre debut extension and then using what has the potential to be major savings if he turns out to be the player they hope on

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
McGonigle seems like a decent candidate for a pre-career extension.  We know these types of deals are in Scott Harris’ wheelhouse since Keith was already locked up before his first MLB game.

====================

SPEAKER: Mariners
---
What has surprised you most this off-season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
About Seattle’s offseason specifically?  I guess I thought they would’ve gotten more for dealing Harry Ford, but Ferrer is a nice bullpen add

====================

SPEAKER: Hello
---
How can the scouts all be so wrong about players like Jordan Walker, or Jo Adell since he HAS to be mentioned in every chat?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Scouting players and identifying future stars is incredibly hard.  Still plenty of time for Walker to get clicking at the MLB level, just as it took Adell several years to finally have a breakout

====================

SPEAKER: Philip rivers
---
Which player do you think could come back and put up reasonable numbers 5 years after retirement ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If Barry Bonds signed as a DH-only bat/pinch-hitting specialist, I think he’d hit at least 20 homers Maybe he should do this just to restart his HOF clock!

====================

SPEAKER: Curious A’s Fan
---
When was the last time a team did a pre-career (or very early career) extension with a pitcher?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
These don’t happen too often.  Ashby’s extension with Milwaukee is the most recent, after some brief checking on the MLB Contract Tracker

====================

SPEAKER: Maple
---
Why do teams non-tender payers only to have them sign for more money in free agency? Moreover, why do other teams not make an offer (cash considerations) for that player before they hit the market? There are alot of teams that would now love to have Pete Fairbanks for his projected arbitration salary that must be kicking themselves.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Rays surely tested the market for Fairbanks before non-tendering him, and the offers weren’t up to par.  So if the Rays perceived that they would have difficulty trading Fairbanks at fair value, they opted to just cut him entirely by declining the option.

====================

SPEAKER: Spencer Jones
---
Is LF mine to lose if Belli signs elsewhere?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Dominguez will get first dibs on the job

====================

SPEAKER: Cubs
---
Are the cubs involved for Okamoto?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They were mentioned as one of the teams in the hunt.  The depth of their interest isn’t known, however.

====================

SPEAKER: Phillies
---
Any chance to move Nola then circle back on Ranger?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Nola’s trade value is pretty minimal considering his contract and his rough 2025

====================

SPEAKER: Spud
---
The Brewers have no depth at shortstop, and a marginal hitter at best manning the position. What are you hearing about the Kiner-Filefa market, and is there a chance he could fall to the Brewers?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
IKF should fall within the Brewers’ price range for bench depth

====================

SPEAKER: Baby Mets
---
Am I the only one who thinks the Mets will not sign any big name Free Agents and will go instead with their young and promising minor league players this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Oops, I loaded that next question before finishing my point on the previous question.IKF raises the talent floor on the roster, but I’m not sure he’s a realistic candidate to actually take over at SS or anything Re: the Mets’ youth movement.That would be an awfully bold move by a team that still has a mega-payroll and should be in win-now mode. Seems hard to believe that the Mets wouldn’t still have a big move in them before the winter is out.

====================

SPEAKER: Win Now
---
With the A’s offense, why wouldn’t a mature, win now pitcher, want to join the A’s?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s a very hitter-friendly park, and the pitcher’s numbers may very well sufferIt is also a very hitter-friendly minor league park, and the pitcher may not want to deal with the extra complication of playing in such a facility

====================

SPEAKER: Overpay
---
Clearly the blue jays over paid for cease (and Santander last year). Will that have negative impact in the next few years?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s only an overpay if they don’t play well, so Santander will have to pick it up in 2026.  The Jays also have a good deal of money coming off the books after the 2026 season. That’s almost two hours of chattin’, so it’s time to wrap things up.  Thanks to everyone for their questions, and I’ll have more chatty goodness next weekend!
