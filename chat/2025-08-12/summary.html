We’ll get going at 1pm CT, but as always, feel free to submit questions ahead of time. Good afternoon! Quiet day and I’m finished eating lunch, so let’s get underway early.</p>
<p><strong>Piratus maximus:</strong> What is Pittsburgh doing?  Trading Hayes looks like starting over. Will Cruz still be around when they’re competitive again?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don’t think dumping the rest of an unwanted Hayes contract constitutes starting over. If they traded Paul Skenes, that would’ve been starting over.Cruz only has three years of club control after this one, and I don’t expect the Bucs to compete in 2026, so I’d lean toward him being traded before the Pirates are genuinely competitive again, though.</p>
<p><strong>He Hate Me:</strong> So, just saving money this off-season and still trying to compete in 2026? Or do the Twins enact a full tear-down, including trades of cost-controlled talent like Joe Ryan (whose value could plummet with an injury in 2026)?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don’t think we can really know which direction they’ll go until their sale process has been completed. If they don’t have a new owner in place — or at least an agreement with a buyer — by the offseason, I’d expect each of Joe Ryan, Ryan Jeffers, Trevor Larnach and Bailey Ober (among others) to be kicked around the trade market this winter — especially the first two.</p>
<p><strong>Frisco Kid:</strong> What are your thoughts about the Giants promoting Bryce Eldridge to the majors?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> He only has 150ish PAs in AAA and they’ve been good, not great, with a 32% strikeout rate. I get the frustration with the big league club and the excitement to see the org’s top prospect, but a 20-year-old who’s K’ing in nearly a third of his Triple-A plate appearances seems like he’d be overmatched in the majors.Plus, calling him up would mean adding him to the 40-man two years earlier than they need to in order to protect him from the Rule 5. You’re eating up a 40-man roster spot for the coming offseason.Earlier in the year, I thought the Giants would call up Eldridge if they were contending and he was mashing in AAA. I tend to think now that the better move is to wait until 2026. It’s not like he’s absolutely forcing the issue with dominant play in Sacramento.</p>
<p><strong>Gaurdiansjoe:</strong> How long are we gonna wait to know if we have our starting pitcher (Ortiz) or our all star closer (Classe)? Should we just assume they are both done for the year? For ever? Seems like we should of heard something, hopefully something good.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> They’re on administrative leave until Aug. 31, so I doubt we’ll hear anything before then. My guess — and it is a total guess, just based on how prior league investigations regarding a variety of topics have played out — is that on 8/31, the league just announces that the leave has been extended through the end of the regular season (or possibly through the World Series), and they’ll quietly continue the investigation with an eye toward announcing discipline in the offseason.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Cohen:</strong> Will the Pirates ever call up Bubba Chandler this year?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> After Aug. 15, players no longer have enough days on the calendar to exhaust their rookie status this year. I’m guessing that on 8/20 or so, Chandler is magically ready for the majors, and he’ll then head into ’26 in position to break camp on the roster and possibly net the Pirates a draft pick via the Prospect Promotion Incentives, depending on ROY voting.</p>
<p><strong>KevininFla:</strong> Do you believe the Padres will make a serious effort to re-sign Michael King in the offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I’d be very surprised if they don’t make a real effort, yes. Cease seems likelier to go, between the two</p>
<p><strong>Peace Love &amp; pancakes:</strong> Look ahead to next year for the Brewers — what might they be seeking in free agency? Do they go with Vaughn at first? Durbin at third? Ortiz at Short? Wait for the middle infield rookies to mature? If they spend any money (always a big if), what night they seek out?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I just don’t expect them to look to spend all that much. Vaughn has all but staked his claim to the 1B job in 2026 with his absurd turnaround. I could see them looking for some left-side infield help, but there aren’t many great options out there in that regard anyhow aside from Bregman or Suarez, I suppose, and the Brewers aren’t ponying up for either.I imagine they’ll be open to adding a veteran starter on a one-year deal and they’ll look for some bench/bullpen upgrades who won’t break the bank. They’ll at least listen to offers on Freddy Peralta, since he’s only signed one more year and that’s just what the Brewers do. But in general, I just wouldn’t get your hopes up for a big-money acquisition. It’s not how they typically operate, and based on how much success they have every year, I’m not really sure it’s how they need to operate.</p>
<p><strong>Joshua:</strong> Thoughts on the Nats starter Brad Lord? He’s been a pleasant surprise, do you think he could be a legit #3 starter? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> He’s been better than I’d have expected, but it’s below-average strikeout levels with good-not-great command and pretty poor chase/swinging-strike rates. A genuine No. 3 mid-rotation arm would surprise me. He feels more like a borderline No. 4/5 guy. He’s having a pretty similar season to Mitchell Parker’s 2024, granted with a lot more grounders (but also more walks and hit batters)</p>
<p><strong>Free Agency:</strong> Does Zac Gallen get a QO next year? Fair to assume King and Woodruff do, injuries notwithstanding?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> All three will get qualifying offers.</p>
<p><strong>AJ Preller:</strong> Tell me I’m not dumb enough to Luis Arreaz to a long-term contract…No power, doesn’t walk, below average defense and speed… money could be spent in other places, right?</p>
