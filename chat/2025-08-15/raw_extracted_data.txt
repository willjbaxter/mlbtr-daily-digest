Hello, subscribers. Thank you, as always, for being so wonderful to us. It is greatly appreciated. Anthony is off this week. Sorry you're stuck with me. Let's talk baseball.

What’s your prediction on how things are going to shake out in the AL West?  Can the Stros tread water enough the rest of the season to take the division?

====================

SPEAKER: Darragh McDonald

It's obviously pretty tight but I would lean Seattle at the moment. Houston has had so many injuries. They've somehow managed to win in spite of them, but it's possible there's a point where they run out of steam. Seattle, on the other hand, made some nice deadline upgrades and has some juice. Just a guess though. It could obviously go either way. Can't predict this sport. Baseball is dumb/amazing like that.

====================

SPEAKER: Wyatt Langford extension?
---
With Roman Anthony getting extended by the Red Sox, have you heard anything re: Chris Young looking into signing Wyatt Langford to a long term deal? I think this would be a great time to do it before he breaks out and before players like Acuña will be seeking new contracts. Thoughts? What would his deal look like?

====================

SPEAKER: Darragh McDonald

I haven't heard anything concrete but it would make sense for them to try. He's only going to get more expensive as he pushes towards free agency. He'll have two years of service after this year. The top guys in that service class are Tatis and Witt, who got to $300ish. Langford hasn't quite got to the superstar level of those guys, however. He'd probably come in underneath them right now. But like I said, he'll get more expensive if he keeps playing well and pushing towards the open market.
