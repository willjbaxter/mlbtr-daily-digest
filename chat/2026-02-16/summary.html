Still, it’s never too late to talk some baseball! Let’s open up the question box….</p>
<p><strong>Padres:</strong> German Marquez?  Really?  Are they really that cash strapped to dive this deep into the dumpster?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Marquez is still relatively young, just a few days away from his 31st birthday.  The Padres have seen plenty of Marquez after facing him for so many years in the NL West, and might very well see some untapped potential now that Marquez is out of Colorado.For a low-cost flier, it’s a decent enough risk for a team that needs rotation depth.</p>
<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Lars Nootbaar makes too much sense for at least a half dozen competitors. Is a May trade a legit possibility once health is proven?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Probably closer to the trade deadline, just so the Cards have more time to gauge offers.  An earlier trade wouldn’t be out of the question since Nootbaar has had some suitors in the past, so STL might have some idea of what certain teams are willing to give up in return</p>
<p><strong>Tim L:</strong> Given there’s some questions on the back end of the Giants rotation and Scherzer is there waiting for an opportunity, is that a situation where there needs to be an injury first or he signs regardless?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Scherzer and Vitello’s close friendship has made the Giants a popular speculative choice as Mad Max’s next team, yet there haven’t really been any actual reports linking the two.  It could be that Scherzer would prefer to play for a more clear-cut contender, i.e. a return to Toronto.Scherzer has said he’s willing to wait until after Opening Day to sign.  That might give him more time to access his options, and perhaps wait and see if an injury or two creates more of a market for him.</p>
<p><strong>Keith:</strong> AA absolutely has to do something now with the Waldrep injury right……right</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> For instance, one might wonder if Scherzer could be an option for the Braves now that Waldrep and Schwellenbach are both out.</p>
<p><strong>Sox Fan:</strong> Do the White Sox have under 100 losses this season?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Will the White Sox lose fewer than 100 games in 2026?Yes(73.4% | 701 votes)No(26.5% | 253 votes)Total Votes: 954</p>
<p><strong>Oops all RH 1Bs:</strong> Given the reporting earlier, is there an actual market for Os 1Bs Mountcastle or Mayo?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Marlins and Rangers stand out as a couple of teams that could use help at either CI position, though who knows if they’ve had any real talks about either Baltimore player.  Mountcastle’s market is pretty limited but there is likely still a good deal of interest in Mayo</p>
<p><strong>Rossy Atkinz:</strong> Is running 162 games with a middle infield of Gimenez and Clement a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> From a defensive standpoint, not at all.  From a hitting standpoint, definitely.  Clement’s great playoff run (and even Gimenez’s multiple clutch hits in October) shouldn’t overshadow their subpar offensive numbers during the season.Davis Schneider will be chipping in at 2B as well, but the Jays are really rolling the dice here on their middle infield plan</p>
<p><strong>Ryan mountcastle:</strong> How am I still on the team?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Feels like the O’s were caught between a rock and a hard place.  They felt Mountcastle was too good to just non-tender (given how injuries might’ve been the key factor in his 2025 slump), yet he is also not good enough to trade for what they’d deem to be a decent return Keeping Mountcastle also gave the Orioles some cover in case they didn’t make a big move at first base, but once Alonso signed, Mounty became even more expendable</p>
<p><strong>Brad:</strong> How many more seasons without the Phillies winning a World Series until trading Bryce Harper suddenly makes sense for both sides?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Harper has a no-trade clause, so the ball would be in his court on this subject.And blaming Harper for the Phillies’ lack of a championship is a wild take</p>
<p><strong>Matt D:</strong> Much like TB, the Brewers tend to win most of their trades. What needs to happen in order for Milwaukee to ‘win’ the Durbin trade? I was very surprised to see Milwaukee give up on Durbin so soon for unproven prospects and a utility IF.</p>
