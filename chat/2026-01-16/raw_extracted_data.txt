Good afternoon, hope you're all well! Interesting week, let's get rolling

====================

SPEAKER: LFGM
---
Head spinning! Lost Tucker, got Bichette all in the course of a day. I don’t think the Mets should trade Baty, if Bichette opts out after year 1 you have no 3B, so two questions, how do the Mets work out 1B, LF & DH if they keep Baty. Do you think Vientos, or Mauricio have the value combined with lesser prospects to get the SP the Mets need/want? Maybe Freddy Peralta?

====================

SPEAKER: Sam
---
Brett Baty on the move?

====================

SPEAKER: Lance
---
Mets have a roster full of middle infielders and at least 1 poor fielding outfielder, how do you see that shaking out?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
A handful of the many Mets questions in here I don't think Vientos (or certainly not Mauricio) has the juice to headline a Peralta deal, but it does feel to me that he's getting traded. Seems likelier than Baty, who offers more positional value as a capable defender at second/third (and presumably first) Seems like the Mets balked at a Vientos/Robert framework at the deadline but I wonder if that's more workable now if Sox eat a chunk of the money or include a reliever other than Grant Taylor in there

====================

SPEAKER: Dave
---
How much of this "rush" from a few well-funded teams to spend large sums for short-term contracts is because of the expectation that the impending lockout will force a salary cap into place?

====================

SPEAKER: Philly A's
---
Are the shorter term but higher AVV contracts because of the possible strike?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I don't think that has much to do with it. Just seems like we had a couple huge spenders that didn't want to go long-term on very good but flawed hitters at the top of the class Obviously if you're not keen on committing seven or eight years to either of these guys, you need to compensate by juicing the AAV. Mets had a ton of short-term spending room compared to last season and were running out of players on which they could use it after missing on Tucker

====================

SPEAKER: Stott Through The Heart And You're To Blame
---
Three years for Realmuto means that Dombrowski is planning on retiring after 2 and letting someone else clean up the mess?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Haha if that were the case, why balk at going to three years in November? I'm a little surprised they caved but credit to JTR and his camp for waiting it out. Seemed like Bichette was the last other player for which they were prepared to spend and once he chose elsewhere, they said "screw it, let's get Realmuto done"

====================

SPEAKER: Justin
---
how do the Tucker and Bichette deals impact Cody Bellinger?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Mets could still accommodate Belli, I guess, but that feels less likely now. Beyond that, not sure it matters much. Dodgers never felt likely there and Yankees never seemed to be in on Tucker. My guess is they get the Yankees to cave on the sixth year and wrap it up

====================

SPEAKER: Shatkins
---
Did aaron judge just become the most underpaid player in the game (besides arb controlled assets)

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
It's Ohtani for me but Judge is second. That deal felt like a win for the Yanks at the time and obviously looks dramatically better with where salaries at the top of the market have gone since

====================

SPEAKER: Soooo
---
What’s next for Boston? I feel like they still need a bat, but I hate to see them lose Early or Tolle. Does some combination of Harrison and Crawford (plus others) get them Paredes?

====================
