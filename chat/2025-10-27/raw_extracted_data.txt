Good afternoon! And happy World Series. We'll get going at 3pm CT, but as always, feel free to submit questions ahead of time if you prefer. Greetings! Let's begin

====================

SPEAKER: Eeyore

Lifelong Mariners fan here… also a big fan of Eugenio Suarez, especially what he brings to the clubhouse..  Wondering what it might take for the M’s to retain him and maybe use him at DH and 3rd.  Dreaming of an offseason where Naylor gets signed, a trade lands Brendan Donovan and Suarez is still in the fold… all with Colt Emerson getting called up at so e point.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams

I don't think there's any chance they keep both Suarez and Naylor and then add someone like Donovan. Individually they're all fine fits, but Suarez is probably going to command $20MM+ annually over 2-3 years, and the Mariners aren't going to spend for a player in his mid-30s when they have Emerson waiting in the wings.Naylor reunion seems possible, particularly if they move some other pieces to make the financial aspect work (assuming ownership isn't going to green-light a major spending hike).Donovan fits the Mariners well, but he's versatile, cheap and good at just about everything on the diamond. He fits every contending club well. Mariners do have a better farm than a lot of (most of) the other teams who'll be looking into him, though.

If Hoyer of the Cubs declined to bring Imanaga back could the Cubs have enough money to sign Cease and Woodruff  ?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams

The Cubs have enough money regardless of Imanaga. They have about $162.5MM in luxury obligations next year, per RosterResource. They could pick up their option on Imanaga, their option on Kittredgeandtheir option on Rea and still be under $200MM in tax considerations. That's enough room to sign Cease and Woodruff and keep under the line in all likelihood -- and that doesn't even consider possible non-tenders (Reese McGuire, Eli Morgan) or trades of any veterans on the roster.

====================

SPEAKER: Rangers13
---
What teams with a need for defensive help would be possible trade partners for AGarcia or Semien if the acquiring team thinks they might be able to return them to close to previous offensive form and who might be options back to the Rangers from those teams?
