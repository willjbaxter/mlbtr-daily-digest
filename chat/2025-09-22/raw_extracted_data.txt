SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s the second-last Weekend Chat of the regular season, so get those questions in now!

====================

SPEAKER: Yosef
---
Out of the dodgers free agents. Realistically who do you think they’ll keep ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
At least one of Rojas/Hernandez, Vesia’s club option is likely being picked up, and Muncy’s club option will still probably be exercised (though I wouldn’t be totally shocked if it isn’t).Beyond that, the other FAs will be let go, and Kershaw is retiring.

====================

SPEAKER: Hot Stove
---
With this hot streak do the reds squeak their way into the playoffs?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Cincinnati is in a wild card spot right now, by dint of holding the tiebreaker over the Mets. The Reds’ final six games are against the Pirates, and against a Brewers team that will probably be resting guys.  So, the Reds’ fate is in their own hands, and it helps that the Mets have just been spiraling.I think I wrote just in last week’s chat that the Reds had really missed an opportunity to take hold of the wild card race.  Clearly they read the Weekend Chat and were so enraged that they went on this winning streak!

====================

SPEAKER: Austin Hays
---
Will my option be picked up by the reds this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s a $12MM mutual option with a $1MM buyout.  Mutual options are virtually never exercised by both sides, so Hays will head to free agency again.

====================

SPEAKER: Dan
---
Will Sonny Gray agree to waive his no trade clause with a rebuild coming?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He wasn’t willing to waive it last year when it also seemed like a rebuild was coming, so I’d lean towards Gray returning.  If he indicated he was willing to be moved, I can see the Cards exploring deals.  Susan Slusser recently reported that the Giants have Gray on their offseason trade radar, and laid out some plausible reasons why Gray might be willing to approve a deal to San Francisco in particular.

====================

SPEAKER: Tim
---
Did you think Morton and Paddock were big movies at the trade deadline?    Morton over 7 era for the tigers.  Paddock over 6.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I didn’t mind either at the time, and to be fair other moves (most notably Kyle Finnegan) have really worked out.At the time of the deadline, the Tigers clearly felt they just needed final touches rather than any major additions.  Hindsight is obviously 20-20 on that, but if they do end up collapsing entirely and missing the playoffs, you’ve got to believe the front office will finally get more aggressive with bigger moves this winter

====================

SPEAKER: Yesavage Fan
---
Will Trey Yesavage get a spot in the bullpen or perhaps even the rotation for the playoffs. He is electric on the mound as I had the pleasure of knowing him since middle school and graduating with him.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s cool that you have such longtime ties to a big leaguer!  Well, maybe not “long time” since middle school wasn’t too long ago for Yesavage.  lol, man, do I ever feel old in seeing all these players debut who are so young.Toronto’s rotation is a total question mark after Gausman and Bieber.  Yesavage might end up getting a start almost by default, if Bassitt is hurt, Scherzer can’t get on track, and if the Jays stick to the plan of having Berrios as a reliever.  It’s a real roll of the dice asking a rookie to make a high-pressure playoff start so early into his career, yet it’s may not that different from having be, say, a multi-inning guy in a similar role Frankly, I think the likeliest scenario is Gausman, Bieber, then “pitching chaos” based on matchups and availability

====================

SPEAKER: M
---
do we think the Astros or the tigers miss the playoffs?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Will the Astros or Tigers miss the playoffs?Both are in(24.8% | 126 votes)Astros make, Tigers miss(23.0% | 117 votes)Tigers make, Astros miss(52.1% | 265 votes)Total Votes: 508 I opted to leave out the “both miss” answer since the Rangers’ collapse has erased that possibility

====================

SPEAKER: Fish Fan
---
Are the Marlins for real? Only 4 games out with a week left in the season? Who saw that coming? Is Clayton the manager of the year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I wonder how many people read this comment, thought “wait, what?” and then did a double take at the standings.  After losing seven of their first eight September games, Miami is now 10-1 in its last 11 games.The math is by no means in their favor to actually make the postseason, but the fact that we’re having this conversation is a testament to the Marlins’ underrated year.

====================

SPEAKER: Charleston Chew
---
How far can the Mariners make provided they get in?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s basically no doubt at this point that Seattle is at least getting in, and they’re really putting an iron grip on the division title.  The Mariners should worry every single opponent they face in October, and are a legit threat to win it all.

====================

SPEAKER: Cleveland
---
Manzardo looks unplayable as a 1B, which is saying something. Could Alonso be in the Guardians budget? A lot of money freed up.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Alonso won’t be even remotely in their price range.

====================

SPEAKER: Drake
---
Do you think the A’s try to lock up any others of their offensive core? (Langeliers, Kurtz, Wilson, Soderstrom)

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
On paper yes, though it remains to be seen if last spring’s extension flurry was just to avoid MLBPA pressure and to hit their spending minimum.If last winter was an anomaly, it may take for the Vegas move to actually happen before we can start thinking about the A’s operating in a somewhat more normal fashion.  Not that they’ll start spending big or anything, but at least more common moves like locking players up to early extensions. In Kurtz’s case, I think he has already priced himself out of the Athletics’ comfort zone.

====================

SPEAKER: Angry Rangers Fan
---
The rangers HAVE to sign either Tucker, Schwarber, or Bregman right? Get a proven hitter to help Seager and Langford in that lineup

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Assuming that Texas indeed stayed under the tax line and reset their taxpayer status, I can see them making (or trying to make) one big splash.

====================

SPEAKER: Carl
---
Charlie Morton……prolly at the end of his career. Awesome career tho!

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Absolutely.  Despite the tough ending, Morton should be proud of his many achievements, if this is indeed the end of the road for him.

====================

SPEAKER: Ken
---
Rank from most to least likely to resign with their current team: Alonso, Schwarber, Bregman, and Tucker

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Schwarber, Bregman, Alonso, and then a big gap before Tucker.  I’d guess Schwarber staying in Philly is borderline probable given how the organization loves him, and Tucker is almost definitely leaving Chicago

====================

SPEAKER: Yankees
---
Do the Yankees shop McMahon for a third baseman that can hit and field, instead of just a one dimensional gap filler?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It was surprising to see New York eat all of McMahon’s salary at the deadline, so if they were willing, I guess another might be too.  But, as good as McMahon’s glove is, the bat just isn’t there.Since the rest of the lineup is full of sluggers, the Yankees might be fine having one glove-first spot in the batting order….especially if Volpe’s defensive issues continue on the left side of the infield.  I don’t think the Yankees make that trade for McMahon if they were just going to flip him this winter.

====================

SPEAKER: Mookie B.
---
How wrecked are we without Smitty?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s a big loss.  The Dodgers have withstood all manner of injuries before, but missing Smith makes that lineup considerably weaker.

====================

SPEAKER: Gaurdsball?!
---
Are we riding a negative run dif into a division title?!

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
A minimal offense suddenly isn’t such a big problem when your pitchers are allowing roughly 1.5 runs per game.

====================

SPEAKER: Rafael Ramirez
---
Do you think Kim picks up his option with the Braves?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think just last week I felt he’d just exercise his player option and take the one-year payday, with the idea of having a full and healthy 2026 to re-establish himself.But, after Kim has continued to hit for several more days now, I think he might have built enough of a platform for Boras to market him for a multi-year deal this winter.  It’ll likely be one of those contract that has multiple opt-outs attached, yet taking such a deal allows Kim more flexibility and more money than simply taking the $16MM for 2026 The other wrinkle here is that the Braves generally don’t do business with Boras clients.  It’s obviously not a hard rule since, you know, Kim is on the team right now.  But, it might add some interesting layers to any talks between Kim and the Braves about an extension.

====================

SPEAKER: Natitude Dude
---
When will the Nats have a GM in place? Any leading favorite(s)?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This post runs down the known candidates linked to the vacancy already:https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/09/nationals-have-interviewed-red-… Hard to say if there’s any kind of a favorite, but the Washington Post reported that Josh Byrnes has yet with the Lerner family.  It’s possible other candidates have at well, so it’s maybe too soon to dub Byrnes as a top choice

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Will the Astros pay Valdez?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
My prediction is that he’s pitching elsewhere in 2026

====================

SPEAKER: SFGigantes
---
Besides Sonny Gray(as previously mentioned) could SFG get Sandy Alcantara from Marlins in the offseason and not have to give up Josiah Gonzales? I wanted us to go get him at the deadline, even tho we had fallen apart.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Marlins being so competitive makes me wonder about Alcantara’s availability.  Chances are that the Fish will still be open to moving that salary and garnering a big return if one can be found, yet if the Marlins think they can properly contend in 2026, perhaps they think about adding instead of subtracting.

====================

SPEAKER: Marky Mark
---
Whats on the Sunday Night Chat Playlist?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“The Crystal Ballroom,” an incredible U2 b-side track

====================

SPEAKER: Cal Raleigh
---
Do you think I can break Judge’s home run record?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Went yard for the 58th time tonight.  Five homers in six-plus games is a tall order, especially since I can see the M’s resting Raleigh for a game or two to keep him fresh for the playoffs.

====================

SPEAKER: Joseph
---
What would it take for the Orioles to land MacKenzie Gore this offseason? He would seem like a great fit next to Rogers and Bradish.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It may depend to some extent on who the Nats’ next PBO/GM is, but I’d expect Washington to still keep a very high ask on Gore’s services.  Even though he faded in the second half and got hurt, a controllable (for two more years) pitcher who has shown frontline stuff merits a big price tag.I’d also think it unlikely that the Orioles in particular could get much traction in talks with the Nats, if there’s any bad blood lingering from The Neverending MASN Dispute

====================

SPEAKER: Derek
---
If the White Sox pick up Robert’s option, would a trade for Bohm work since it fills a need for both teams?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Just as salary offset, since Bohm doesn’t have much value to a rebuilding team like the ChiSox.

====================

SPEAKER: Acuna
---
Any chance Braves trade me,would look good in right field  for the Cubs?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s zero chance Acuna is traded.  Why would the Braves do that?

====================

SPEAKER: carpathian florist
---
Bigger disappointment- Mets missing the postseason or tigers missing the postseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Certainly the Mets, based on payroll and higher expectations going into the season.

====================

SPEAKER: Pirates
---
Do we take a big swing trade wise in the offseason? Maybe trade for Taylor Ward by giving some of our insane pitching depth?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ward is set for free agency following the 2026 season, so I’m not sure if the Bucs want to give up one of their prized young arms for just one year of his services.

====================

SPEAKER: Cookie Monster
---
What is it going to take for the Cubs to fire everyone?  Non

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They’ve made the playoffs and will finish with the third or fourth best record in the National League.  Hoyer just signed an extension two months ago.  Counsell is under contract through 2028.

====================

SPEAKER: Bucs Fan
---
Thoughts on Cherington’s comments? Any free agents/trades Pirates could go/make after this offseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If not necessarily Taylor Ward, getting 2-3 experienced and proven bats would be a huge help.  Since we can’t assume the Pirates will spend to sign anyone notable, that puts the onus on Cherington to trade a controllable young pitcher for a controllable young hitter, and hope to score much bigger than the Priester-for-Yorke swap.

====================

SPEAKER: pizzashill
---
Can you name a catcher season you would take over 2025 cal Raleigh?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Probably some Josh Gibson years, but that might literally be it in all of baseball history.  Just an incredible year for Raleigh.

====================

SPEAKER: Bostonpaul
---
Who do you see thr Red Sox extending qualified offer to after the season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Giolito probably, and the others are all either ineligible (Bregman, Story if he opts out) or non-candidates

====================

SPEAKER: 2027 Season
---
Is it all but certain that we will have both a salary cap and floor for the 2027 season?  It seems to be the middle ground between yes floor and yes cap, and the fans seem to be in favor.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The fans don’t have a say in CBA talks.  The players have long been steadfast in refusing any sort of cap, and I don’t see them bending now.

====================

SPEAKER: Twins
---
Will Minnesota spend money this off-season

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Nope

====================

SPEAKER: Moneyball
---
Thoughts on a Severino for Cronenworth trade? Pads probably need pitching, even just depth, unload cronenworths contract. A’s could use a vetern left handed infielder with uncertainty around Gelof, Hernaiz, etc.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Cronenworth is owed $60MM from 2026-30, and he has a partial eight-team no-trade clause.  Chances are that the A’s are on that list just because most guys don’t want to play in a minor league park.Severino only has $42MM remaining on his deal (over the 2026-27 seasons), so the money doesn’t entirely match up either.

====================

SPEAKER: Some guy
---
Realistic expectations for my White Sox next year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Getting under the 100-loss mark.  Chicago has 98 losses with six games remaining, so they’ll almost surely hit triple digits again.It shouldn’t be overlooked that this is still a big improvement over their rock-bottom showing in 2024, by almost a 20-game margin.  Obviously 2024 was an outlier and 2025 has been more of a “normal” type of bad season, but there are some signs of progress.

====================

SPEAKER: Vito Acconci
---
Best Radiohead album? the Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, Amnesiac, or A Moon Shaped Pool?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Don’t forget “In Rainbows,” which might be my pick

====================

SPEAKER: BB fan
---
What is going on with Minnesota with their penny pinching?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ownership has heavy debts, and wasn’t able to find anyone to both buy the team and take on all/most of that debt.  Between that and the loss of TV revenue, the impact is being felt on the baseball payroll.

====================

SPEAKER: Jeff
---
If Scherzer can’t get right, do the Jays leave him off the playoff roster entirely?  Hard to see a spot for him in a 12 man pen with Lauer and Berrios down there.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s hard to see Scherzer being omitted entirely, given his long history.  Plus, like I mentioned earlier, there’s enough uncertainty about the 3rd/4th starter roles that Scherzer might well still end up with a rotation job

====================

SPEAKER: Ron Washington
---
Should I return next season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He wants to, and I can see the Angels bringing him back as something of a do-over since health issues sidelined him for so much of this year

====================

SPEAKER: Alpa Chino
---
Who ya got for NL ROY?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Off the top of my head, Cade Horton, but I’d have to double-check all the numbers

====================

SPEAKER: JeffyM
---
If Santander and Bo are both back for the playoffs who do you think gets left off?  Loperfido, France and IKF?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
France is likely off.  I’d like to keep both IKF and Loperfido if possible, and for a Jays team that’s had trouble scoring runs lately, you’d think Loperfido (who’s still got an OPS in the high 800s) would get more at-bats.

====================

SPEAKER: Hunt for Reds October
---
No matter how it turns out (hopefully for the better), isn’t it still obvious the Reds HAVE to improve the offense in the off-season?  How often do we have to face this before they actually do anything?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Agreed.  With the pitching becoming such a strength, adding some real bats could make Cincinnati into a big threat quickly (if they aren’t already).

====================

SPEAKER: Mets choke fest
---
Who’s to blame for the Mets collapse?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The pitching has just evaporated.  To that extent it’s on the rotation themselves, yet David Stearns’ unusual (but usually successful) method of building a pitching staff really backfired on the Mets this year.

====================

SPEAKER: Dodger Dave
---
Mark, if the Dodgers put Teo on the market this Winter, what kind of interest/return do you think they can get for him?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s $33MM owed to Hernandez through 2027, counting the buyout of his 2028 club option.  There’s also a ton of deferred money involved in his contract as a whole, but let’s go with $33MM as a baseline.Hernandez currently has an exactly average 100 wRC+, with a big decrease in power from 2024 and his already-low walk rate has hit a new career low.  His trade value isn’t nil, but a lot of teams are going to see this season as a pretty good reason to stay away

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Naylor to the Reds? Or is he staying where he is?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Naylor would be a very nice boost to the Cincinnati offense, but I’m not sure if the Reds are willing to meet his asking price.

====================

SPEAKER: Marsey
---
Bees?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Beads?!

====================

SPEAKER: Gapsmith
---
Realistically, how far can the Phillies go without Zach Wheeler?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Common sense would seem to dictate that the Phils can’t win without their ace.  The rest of the rotation is still good, however, and the offense might just be able to outslug other teams, so I can’t rule Philly out. We’re about two hours in here, so let’s call it a wrap.
