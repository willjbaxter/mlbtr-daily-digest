<p><strong>Kevin in Tx:</strong> Does Texas rid themselves of Adolis Garcia this winter, his last year of arbitration, Iâm guessing a raise to about $12-17 million.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> It&#x27;d be much closer to 12 than 17. He&#x27;s not getting an $8M arbitration raise coming off this kind of season. Agree that he&#x27;s getting non-tendered anyways though</p>
<p><strong>RoxTalks:</strong> Will Brandon Woodruff be extended the QO after he declines his end of the QO?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> He&#x27;s got a $20M mutual option with a $10M buyout. Just clarifying what the questioner means by &quot;declines his end&quot; We&#x27;ll see how he finishes the year but yeah, I think we&#x27;re trending towards him receiving and declining the QO. Based on our FA deliberations this week, it seems like I&#x27;m the low person on staff about Woodruff&#x27;s earning power, but there&#x27;s a lot higher upside than there are with some guys who either received the QO last winter (Severino, Martinez) or signed for the same amount (Buehler) I feel like Eovaldi&#x27;s 3/75 is the absolute ceiling and would have him more as a high-AAV two year guy right now, but others at MLBTR (especially Tim Dierkes) think there&#x27;s a path to a much better deal than that if he shoves through the end of the season and into the playoffs</p>
<p><strong>GWA:</strong> Are the Yanks cooked for 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Eh, I still think they&#x27;ll hang onto a Wild Card spot. The bullpen&#x27;s better on paper than it has pitched. It&#x27;s tough to feel great about them with how badly they&#x27;ve played for the better part of two months, but there&#x27;s a lot of talent on the roster and they&#x27;re still in playoff position right now</p>
<p><strong>Alan V:</strong> Who gets your vote for worst owner in Baseball? It could come from Colorado, Anaheim, Pittsburgh, Miami, Oakland Or the Chicago White Sox.</p>
