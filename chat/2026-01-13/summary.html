I’ll get going at 1pm CT, give or take a couple minutes. As always, feel free to submit some questions ahead of time. I’ll take a mix of preloaded ones and live ones after we begin! Greetings! Apparently someone re-lit the stove.</p>
<p><strong>Toronto Mike:</strong> Reports state that Bo is seeking 300 million.  Do you see him getting this kind of money?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> No, I don’t, but if the real goal is something like $250MM, then of course you say you’re looking closer to 300.I still think it’s probably somewhere in the 225 range, but we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Jagger:</strong> Do you think Colin Rea gets traded to a club that needs pitching now that he is on the outside of the Cubs rotation?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Rea signed as a free agent, meaning he can’t be traded without his consent until June 15. This is his second straight one-year deal with the Cubs, and he’s a midwest guy who wants to be in the midwest. He’s not getting traded. He’ll be in a swing role, which is surely fine with him. He’s used to it. And with injuries, he’ll probably still start 10+ games (as long as he remains healthy himself)</p>
<p><strong>Nolan Arenado:</strong> Assuming St Louis can’t trade me, why not take a page from the Angels book and defer the remaining contract over 3 or 4 years and cut me loose?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> One of the very earliest questions from this morning, ha. What a difference a few hours makes!</p>
<p><strong>brewers fan:</strong> Thoughts on the Nolan arenado trade?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> It’s about what I expected. The Cardinals ate 70% of the money and got basically no return. Arenado at two years and $11MM is a fine value for the D-backs. It works for all parties. Also, not trying to disparage Jack Martinez there, but he was an eighth-round senior sign who took below slot value last summer in the draft. He’s not a big get for the Cardinals. Hopefully they can turn him into something, but this trade was about clearing as much cash as possible and putting Arenado in a spot that’s better for him, his family, and his career goals.</p>
<p><strong>Jays Fan:</strong> How much money do you think Jays would have to retain to move Berrios? 3/66 left but a 37 year old Merill Kelly just signed for 2/40. Guessing there’d be more interest near the end of spring when injuries start happening.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Kelly is just better than Berrios, period. Berrios is durable, but he’s had a K% under 20 in three of the past four seasons. His command is more good now than great like it once was. His average fastball last year was 93 mph — a career-low and a full mile drop from the prior season.I don’t think he’d get half what he’s making right now on the open market, but due to scarcity and the difficulty of winning a free agent bidding, maybe some team would take him if Toronto ate 50% of the contract. At that point, they might just be better off keeping him though. It’s not like they’re 12-deep in genuine rotation options or anything. For the record, my vote in that Tucker poll was also for the Jays So I am with the majority here, it seems.</p>
<p><strong>Bader:</strong> Am I good fit for the Dbacks or will they go with Alek Thomas in CF?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Good on-paper fit, sure, but the D-backs are within $20MM or so of last year’s payroll and still need multiple relievers — all while trying to scale back their spending. I don’t think Bader works there. He should get $10MM+ annually on a multi-year deal (at least in my view, though the market has thumbed its nose at him a bit in the past)</p>
<p><strong>O’s Fan:</strong> Is the hold up on Valdez and Suarez due to teams not being willing to get close to the Cease deal and agents like Scott Boras marketing their client as equal to Cease thus leading to a stallmate?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Boras doesn’t rep Valdez.He does rep Suarez, but he also has to know Ranger was never going to be as desirable as Cease.Holdup is more just about waiting for anyone to meet the asking price. In some cases, they might be told they need to wait to see how the Kyle Tucker/Bo Bichette etc markets play out, as those clubs could pivot to run prevention if they don’t get their guys.We’ve already seen some reports that the Red Sox might look back at pitching now that they missed on Bregman. But no way they were giving out 100+ for a starter while they were still trying to keep Bregman there.</p>
<p><strong>Philly Billy:</strong> Sign Bichette and trade Bohm to the Angels, unless Bichettes defense wouldn’t offset his offense.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> This scenario makes perfect sense to me, and I think Bichette would be fine at either second base or third base (though for arm strength purposes, the former seems a better fit) Pirates make some sense for Bohm, too.</p>
<p><strong>bmcferren:</strong> Pirates are in on Lawler? Is he a better bet than Vientos?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Both seem like reasonable targets, although I will say, Lawlar does not seem like he’s going to be a capable 3B defender. That’s also probably true of Vientos, though.Both are more along the lines of the Jhostynxon Garcia addition — high-upside, limited/no MLB track record — than the type of more established bats the Pirates were hoping to acquire though.</p>
<p><strong>JD:</strong> Colby Thomas from the A’s for Alec Bohm, who says no?</p>
