We’ll start up once a few questions start piling into the queue…</p>
<p><strong>Pirates 2026 World Series Champions:</strong> Pirates are 3-0 in spring training. Are they the greatest team of all time??</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Yes. The next CBA will be built around how to level competitive balance so powerhouse teams like Pittsburgh can be held in check.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> What do you see with #4 and #5 starter for Braves.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’ll be Holmes and I guess Elder as the fifth for now?  Holmes I think can deliver a decent season but there’s a lot less confidence in Elder.  Martin Perez isn’t a bad placeholder for the fifth spot, or maybe the Braves can use multiple pitchers to patch things up until (or if?) the injured guys are back.Or, maybe the easiest solution is that Atlanta just signs a starter</p>
<p><strong>Royals Fan:</strong> Local sports radio saying anything short of the playoffs for the Royals would be a disappointment.  I am not seeing it based on the lack of offseason movement.  Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Tigers are the favorites in the ALC but I wouldn’t be shocked if the Royals won the division.  That might be an easier path to the playoffs than a wild card, since there are lots of good teams battling for those extra AL slots.The Royals have a good roster on paper, but I wish they’d gone bigger with their outfield upgrades.</p>
<p><strong>Guards Fan:</strong> How much does Rhys Hoskins move the needle for the Guardians offense?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Speaking of teams that should’ve done more to help their lineup…..Hoskins has been decent over the last two years, with the caveats of injury rust and his thumb sprain perhaps preventing him from achieving greater heights.  Cleveland’s not really asking him to be anything more than a platoon bat provided that Manzardo and Kayfus hit as expected, though even as a platoon specialist, Hoskins isn’t exactly a lefty-masher.In short, don’t expect the Phillies version of Hoskins to suddenly re-emerge in 2026.  He’s a logical signing for the Guardians but probably not a difference-maker for a lineup that really needs it</p>
<p><strong>Is a 102 ops+:</strong> Really that much better than a 98 ops +</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> /Nigel Tufnel voiceYeah, it’s four better.</p>
<p><strong>Lloyd Dobbins:</strong> Suppose the Braves flop and miss the playoffs again in 2026. Does Alex Anthopoulus’s seat start to get warm?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Not likely.  AA is under contract through 2031, and his track record with the team is strong enough to withstand even two rough seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Campbell Soup:</strong> Do you think teams around the league have asked the Sox about Kristian Campbell?  Or is the long-term agreement something that would turn teams off / be unwilling to send something of value?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Sox surely haven’t given up on Campbell less than a year after making such a big financial commitment.  I’m sure some teams have made some creative offers, though you’re right in that Campbell’s extension kind of blocks out any “buy low” offers.</p>
<p><strong>Marky Mark:</strong> Hey Mark, why not continue the trafition…what’s on the Playlist tonight??</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> “Victim of Luck” by Metric</p>
<p><strong>nick krall:</strong> i usually talk about the reds but what do you think about danny coulombe to the red sox? perfect fit in that bullpen and they are in need of LH relievers.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’d be a good fit, sure.  Frankly, I’m not sure why Coulombe hasn’t been signed yet, unless teams were scared off his age and his poor numbers after the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Ao:</strong> Jesus made debut this year?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #999; font-style: italic;">... and 90 more exchanges</p></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><a href="../../index.html">← Back to All Posts</a><a href="#">Top ↑</a></div></div></body></html>
