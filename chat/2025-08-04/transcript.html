<p><strong>Jon D:</strong> If I understand the post-deadline rules, minor leaguers can still be traded, yes? If so, I think the Red Sox need to get Trey Mancini from the D-Backs. I think this can still be done and he could (hopefully) help fill a hole at 1B that Breslow couldn&#x27;t address. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Ran through post-deadline acquisition rules here over the weekend:https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/08/how-to-acquire-players-after-th...Some, not all minor leaguers can be traded. Any player who&#x27;s on a minor league contract that has not been selected to the majors this season is eligible. He can only be traded for cash, a PTBNL or other minor leaguers who&#x27;ve not had their contracts selected to a major league roster. The PTBNL cannot be someone on a 40-man roster or someone else who&#x27;s been previously on a big league roster.There are some oddball exceptions. Cavan Biggio was traded last September because he&#x27;d been released from his prior major league contract (not had that contract outrighted) and signed a new minor league deal with the Giants, for instance. But by and large, you can cross off the idea of trading for the vast majority of players who&#x27;ve appeared on a major league roster or injured list all season. Mancini is eligible to be traded, though if the Red Sox felt he was a prominent upgrade to their first base situation, they could&#x27;ve already acquired him from the D-backs for a song. Arizona isn&#x27;t going to give Mancini much of a look (if any look at all) -- not after acquiring Tyler Locklear to play 1B going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Duffy Scliff:</strong> Will the Royals pick up Salvyâs player option at seasonâs end? And should they?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> It&#x27;s a club option, not a player (or else it&#x27;d be Perez&#x27;s call, not the team&#x27;s!)Semantics aside, I expect they will. Perez is a franchise icon at this point, and while his seasonlong numbers aren&#x27;t great, he&#x27;s hitting .290/.339/.584 over his past 250 plate appearances. That&#x27;s 48% better than league-average.It&#x27;s a $13.5MM club option with a $2MM buyout, so it&#x27;s really only a net $11.5MM decision for Kansas City. I&#x27;d be surprised if they bought him out.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> If you were the A&#x27;s, what off-season moves would you make with an eye toward contending in the postseason in 2026?</p>
