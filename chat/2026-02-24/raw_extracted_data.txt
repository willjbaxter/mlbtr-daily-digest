SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Good morning! We’ll get going at 1pm CT, give or take a couple minutes, but feel free to start sending questions in anytime. Good afternoon! Let’s get this started up

====================

SPEAKER: Sox Fan
---
Could the White Sox just release Benintendi? I think he’s taking up at bats from others

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Doubtful with two years and $32MM to go. He was at least a league-average hitter last year. They’ll hope for a decent enough first half to be able to trade him and save a few million bucks. If he really struggles at the plate this season though, I can see it happening midyear.

====================

SPEAKER: Wayward
---
The Bucs standing pat now?  Things have gone quiet at 3B, and it seems that they want to see what Urquidy and some of the young arms in Barco and Harrington can give them potentially, especially since it appears Jones could be ready in late May.  I really thought they would have signed Anderson or Corbin.

====================

SPEAKER: Bucco Basement
---
What is up with these minor league deals for guys who can still impact a team? Did they just wait around too long to see if they could increase their salary or are they much worse than I’m assuming? I want my Pirates to get Tyler Anderson or Patrick Corbin and I’m wondering if either could be gotten on a MiLB deal.

====================

SPEAKER: Pirates1Fan
---
I think the Bucs need another arm – Patrick Corbin a fit?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
So, Pirates fans really want them to sign another cheap starter. I feel like they already did this with Urquidy. I get that they’ve signed a cheap lefty pretty much every spring under Cherington (Quintana, Heaney, Martin Perez, Tyler Anderson the first time around) But I don’t think it’s a big need with the depth they have already.You’ve got Skenes, Chandler, Keller, Ashcraft, Urquidy … Jared Jones on the mend and maybe back late April/May. Thomas Harrington, Hunter Barco in Triple-A. Mike Clevinger as a non-roster guy. I do think it’s feasible that either Anderson or Corbin has to settle for a non-roster deal, and if it’s with the Bucs, sure, great. More depth is never bad. But I don’t think it’s super appealing for one of those guys to jump into a rotation mix that has like 8-10 options already — at least not on a non-guaranteed deal.

====================

SPEAKER: Yamama
---
Feelings on Yamamoto this year? Back to back deep playoff runs, in the WBC this year, regression on the horizon?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
One of the ten best pitchers in baseball. I’m not worried about him

====================

SPEAKER: Jj
---
Is there any way that scherzer signs with St. Louis?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
He wants to pitch for a contender and is in talks about returning to the Jays. He’s not going to sign in St. Louis, and I don’t think the Cards would have all that much interest in giving those innings to a 41-year-old when they have a bunch of arms to look at (Mizzou connection notwithstanding)

====================

SPEAKER: Trader Phil
---
Is there any shot of a Skubal trade midseason? He seems destined to leave in free agency, but are the Tigers really going to let him walk for nothing even if they ‘re contending?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
The only way they trade Skubal is if they’re somehow like 10 games out at the deadline

====================

SPEAKER: JeffyM
---
Would a Lauer for Romero swap work for the Jays and Cards?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Rebuilding Cardinals aren’t going to want to swap Romero for another one-year rental.

====================

SPEAKER: Pete
---
If jays release berrios this season, can he potentially still opt in to 27/28 player options?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
The player options are guaranteed money. If they release him, they owe him the entire three years and $66MM. (They won’t release him.)

====================

SPEAKER: Ryan Z
---
Who’s the Nats’ opening day 1B? On house option are pretty thin – Andres Chaparro, or slide Luis Garcia over from 2b. Seems like the should have made a buy-low trade or addition.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I tend to agree. I don’t see why they wouldn’t have just signed Hoskins for a year and $2MM or so. I figure it’ll be Garcia sliding over to 1B, but I just wouldn’t have tendered a contract to him. I don’t really get the approach there. I suppose he’ll share time with Chaparro, but this seems like it was an easy area to add a veteran bat to help make the lineup more respectable and maybe flip for a middling prospect at the deadline.

====================

SPEAKER: Brody McBroseph
---
What’s with the new fonts on MLBTR? Why are the “writer” names in all caps now? DON’T SHOUT AT ME!

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Ha, yeah. Our developers are implementing a more uniform design with our other sites, but there are still some tweaks that need to be made. The fonts look a little wonky now, but sounds like they’ll be in line with the desktop designs at Hoops Rumors, Pro Hockey Rumors and Pro Football Rumors soon.Caught me off guard this morning, too, before Tim Dierkes sent an email update.

====================

SPEAKER: Drew
---
O/U 39 HRs for Suarez in Cincy?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I’ll take the under but not by a ton. He’s only cleared 39 twice though, and he’s turning 35 in July. I’d probably feel more comfortable picking somewhere in the low 30s. I will hereby make 32 my official prediction. Very scientific process.

====================

SPEAKER: David Silver
---
Who’s the giants closer this year? Ryan Walker the frontrunner?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Walker is the frontrunner by default. San Francisco’s bullpen looks … well, bad. I can’t believe they did so little to address it.

====================

SPEAKER: Matt Mervis
---
Don’t forget me at first base for the Nats!

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don’t think Mervis is ever going to make enough contact to be a steady presence on a big league roster.

====================

SPEAKER: AA
---
Is Sale’s contract going to age well?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
It’s a one-year deal. Even if it doesn’t age well, it’s not a huge deal. I liked that arrangement for all sides.

====================

SPEAKER: Bob
---
Does the Chris Sale extension increase his trade value if the Braves find themselves out of contention again this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Anthopoulos made clear last year he wasn’t interested in selling when they were out of it in July. Sale said he wants to play the rest of his career in ATL. Anthopoulos said he wants him to finish it there.Not everything is going to boil down to a trade. Unless Sale asks for one, I would be surprised if he suits up anywhere else.

====================

SPEAKER: Brook
---
Will the Yanks bring in a RH OF or live with Dominquez?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I think they’ll either sign one or use Caballero in the OF some. Dominguez should be playing every day, which means sending him to AAA — not sitting him on the bench 4-5 times per week and getting him a stray start and pinch-hit appearance here or there.

====================

SPEAKER: Ayden
---
Do you think that the rays will end up trading Yandy Diaz?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Nope

====================

SPEAKER: steve84084
---
Giolito and Littel. Possible interest by the Twins?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I would be surprised if, after Tom Pohlad talked about how he wants to be aggressive and show the fans they’re still trying to win (lol?), they don’t have at least some interest.Right now, I’d pick the Twins to sign one of them.Though realistically, they could also just give Tyler Anderson or Patrick Corbin like $2MM, too, which would feel very on-brand for the Pohlads.

====================

SPEAKER: Jay
---
What’s the chances of Charlie Condon breaking camp with the Rockies

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Almost none. He has 237 PAs above A-ball. He hit well but fanned at a 29% clip in Double-A. He doesn’t need to be added to the 40-man roster (to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft) until after the 2027 season. I could see a summer promotion if he’s decimating AAA and the Edouard Juliens and TJ Rumfields of the world aren’t doing much at 1B in Denver, but not Opening Day

====================

SPEAKER: Walter
---
Which injured riddled Guardians prospects will finally provide major league impact?  Delauter? Valera? or Espino?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
DeLauter > Valera >>>>>> Espino, for me That’s in terms of likelihood. On a pure talent basis, Espino by all accounts sounds like a monster, but he’s pitched like 17 innings since Opening Day 2022.

====================

SPEAKER: Frustrated Angels fan
---
Could the Angels sign one of the remaining FA starters? Not named Tyler Anderson

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
They’ve made it pretty clear they’re not interested in spending any real money this winter. I guess they could sign Patrick Corbin for like … $3MM?

====================

SPEAKER: Mutual option
---
When was the last time someone picked me up? Why does no one take me seriously? Why do people keep putting me in contracts just to turn me down?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Aramis Ramirez and the Brewers in 2014 Mutual options are just accounting measures. It’s basically a fancy way to defer money. The Padres do this a lot, for instance. Cheap salary in year one, big buyout on a mutual option for the following season, which pushes the remainder of that salary to the following year’s books.

====================

SPEAKER: Weird trade
---
Soler and a back end prospect for Yoshida with the Red Sox eating half of next year’s salary?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don’t see why the Angels would want to give up a prospect to take on more money for another overpaid DH (even with the Red Sox eating part of the Yoshida deal)They’re free of Soler next winter (or this season, if they cut him loose). Even if you think Yoshida is marginally better, he’s a platoon DH who’s poor in the field. I don’t see any reason to lock that in a year early.

====================

SPEAKER: Hello Steve
---
as it stands where would you rank the reds pitching staff as of right now, or just the rotation if you prefer?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I like the rotation much better than the bullpen. Rotation is probably top-five in the majors, for me.

====================

SPEAKER: Matt
---
If healthy, how will the Royals bullpen rank this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Middle of the pack? Estevez is fine but less exciting than he was a few years. ago. Strahm is good. Big Erceg fan. Rest of the group is serviceable.I don’t think there’s enough swing-and-miss in the group as a whole, and the final few spots don’t inspire tons of confidence (Lange, Falter, etc)

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
what are the chances that Konnor Griffin is named the starting shortstop after spring training ends. He has hit 2 monster homers so far in today’s game against the Red Sox

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
It’ll be a good litmus test to see how serious they are about competing. Obviously it depends on how he performs this spring. In past seasons I’d have said zero chance. Now, if he has a monster spring and the Pirates want to show they’re serious about trying to turn the corner, you’ve got to consider it.There’s no scientific way to put “odds” or “chances” on this sort of thing. I find it plausible but less than likely. 20-30%?

====================

SPEAKER: NRI players
---
Do they have to make the opening day roster or be released?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
No. A lot of them will just head to Triple-A. Depends somewhat on their service time; it’s different for guys with 6+ years of service who finished the preceding season on a big league roster/injured list (aka Article XX(b) free agents). Those guys have uniform opt-out dates built into their minor league contracts

====================

SPEAKER: Wayne
---
It’s looking more and more like Houston is not trading Paredes before the season starts. What are your feelings on that whole situation? I think he’s insurance for when Correa gets injured.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I think they can make it all work in general, but I understand the idea that they’d prefer to be allocating that $9MMish to a similarly productive lefty-hitting outfielder, so I expect that they’ll keep exploring the market for options. As you alluded to, one injury and the “logjam” doesn’t look so … log…jamm-y……….

====================

SPEAKER: Ms fan
---
What do you think of the Ms not being willing to include Cole Young in a deal for Ketel Marte?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I think fans tend to read too literally into such things. I doubt the D-backs ever said “We’ll do Young for Marte straight up.” I’m sure the Mariners would have done that.The idea that the Mariners considered adding Cole Young (on top ofthe sort of young pitching the D-backs were known to be seeking) to be a dealbreaker? That I can buy, sure.

====================

SPEAKER: Squinky
---
I dont get the loperfido sanchez trade? More power? Loperfido the better all round player

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Based on his 100 PAs in the majors last year? Sanchez is a fine defensive corner outfielder with plus bat speed and power against righties. Loperfido was a league-average hitter in AAA last year.I don’t think it’s outlandish to say Loperfido could outperform Sanchez, but I don’t agree that Loperfido is clearly better. The Jays (obviously) don’t, either.

====================

SPEAKER: Christopher
---
With some injuries popping up… Do you see any significant trades revisited?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Isaac Paredes still feels like he could go

====================

SPEAKER: Billy
---
When is the “out of options” post scheduled?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Hmm, good shout. We’ll get that together soon.

====================

SPEAKER: Friars
---
Could Tyler Anderson be an option for the Nats? What about Wilmer Flores at first base?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Either works, sure. Anderson especially. They just need more innings there.

====================

SPEAKER: Dipoto
---
Do i extend another one of the core players on the team this spring? If so who will it be?  Sure worked out Great last spring!

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they try to extend Brendan Donovan. Bryan Woo is an obvious one, too.

====================

SPEAKER: Spud
---
It feels like a Jake Bauers for Mark Vientos trade make sense for both the Brewers and Mets. What say you?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I’m definitely not trading four years of Vientos for one of Bauers.

====================

SPEAKER: Jason
---
assuming health, what kind of season can we expect from luke keaschal? last year was a pretty SSS, can he sustain those numbers over a full season?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
All he’s done dating back to college is hit. He doesn’t make tons of hard contact or have tons of raw power, but I’ll still take the over on the roughly .260/.350/.400 slash that both ZiPS and Steamer are projecting for him.

====================

SPEAKER: Jrue
---
Who is the most exciting pitching prospect to make their MLB debut this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Assuming I can’t choose anyone who tossed even one pitch in the majors last year … Thomas White? Noah Schultz? Gage Jump? Andrew Painter

====================

SPEAKER: Djboy2898
---
As much as I would like for the Giants to sign Giolito and go to a 6 man rotation I still think that one of our younger guys step up and give them quality innings and that someone will get moved to the pen to help it out as well. Although it just maybe wishful thinking lol

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I’d much rather undo the Houser signing (or the Mahle signing) and sign Giolito for whatever he’s going to get now than give out either of those deals that they did.

====================

SPEAKER: West Coast Mets Fan
---
Hey, why no love for McClean as a guy who threw a pitch last year?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
McLean is awesome Question was about someone who’s going to make their MLB Debut this year

====================

SPEAKER: Cool Mama Bell
---
The Cards rotation looks like a mess. Isn’t there one FA starter they can sign to help stop the inevitable losing streak(s)?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Yeah they’re another team I’d like to see add some stability. Not sure they will, though. I really dislike spending $12MM on Dustin May for them. Zero faith in him staying healthy

====================

SPEAKER: White Sox Fan
---
Chances of a playoff Wild Card this season?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Still putting them fourth or fifth (probably fifth) in the ALC

====================

SPEAKER: Dismayed in Anaheim
---
What do you make of the comments that winning isn’t a priority to fans?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Arte Moreno’s quest to make the Angels the biggest circus in MLB is super entertaining from an outsider’s perspective (in a “can you believe this guy?!” kind of way), but I’d be egging Angel Stadium if I were a Halos fan.

====================

SPEAKER: Drew
---
Colton Emerson going to make is MLB Debut in 2026?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Yeah I think Emerson will be up in Seattle this summer for sure, if not sooner.

====================

SPEAKER: Jason
---
Any chance the Mets extend Freddy Peralta, or is he destined for free agent, what’s his next contract look like?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I’ll be shocked if they don’t try.I said as soon as they acquired him that I think Stearns will try to get him to sign a short-term, super-high AAV extension. (4/140?) Starting in 2027

====================

SPEAKER: Chris M
---
If Seattle extends Donovan what kind of contract do you see him getting?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Somewhere around Tommy Edman money? (5/70) Maybe a bit more.

====================

SPEAKER: John
---
Dynasty question:  If you already have EDLC and Jesus Made, would you still draft Connor Griffin over Nolan Mclean?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I’d take Konnor Griffin over everyone, regardless of the rest of your roster. Can always trade. Plus, I love Nolan McLean a lot, but pitchers break.

====================

SPEAKER: Dave Mc
---
The Orioles spent money and got a few guys but does their winter seem incomplete to you? Like they needed one more bullpen arm or needed to aim a little higher in rotation signings?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Yeah, I am generally underwhelmed by them.I don’t mind trading for Baz, but I would’ve liked that to be the lower-tier addition to the rotation. Taylor Ward just feels like taking a mulligan for what Tyler O’Neill wasn’t.I’m not sure there’s an actual aversion to long-term deals for pitching with Mike Elias (GM/president of bb ops), but he’s certainly painting that narrative with his actions Or rather his inactions

====================

SPEAKER: Adam Stevens
---
is there an MLBTR fantasy league? If so whos the reigning champ?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
We haven’t done one forever. I think I won the last one. Either that or the second-to-last one. Flags fly forever — even if you don’t remember what order they came in. I also inexplicably won the Pro Football Rumors/MLBTR football league like eight years ago, which is hilarious given how casual I am (well, was) with football at the time. That was a stone cold fluke and could never happen if we did another one

====================

SPEAKER: Jsh1993
---
Who’s the closer in ATL? Iglesias or Suarez?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
They said as soon as they signed Suarez that Iglesias is closing and Suarez is setting up

====================

SPEAKER: #1 Giants Fan
---
Who could the Giants snag that’s an impact bullpen piece through trade? Jojo Romero is a name that comes to mind, but there’s a bigger need in the closer role. Any thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Not much left out there in terms of impact. Michael Kopech is the best remaining upside play.

====================

SPEAKER: Walter
---
Steven Kwan plays entire season in CF? If the kids come through would Guards trade him at the deadline?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Hard to see trading Kwan if they’re contending for the AL Central, but I also don’t think they’re going to contend for the division with the complete dud of an offseason they’ve had, so yeah, I can definitely see Kwan being traded.I don’t see why he can’t handle CF, given how elite he is in LF. I just wish the move to CF would have been prompted by the addition of a legitimate bat for left field rather than the “by default” means we’re getting since ownership seems to have set the payroll budget at like $65MM. Sucks for CLE fans

====================

SPEAKER: Coop
---
Hey Steve, thanks for the chat! Are there any smoldering embers that could turn into sparks over a Nico Hoerner trade or does it seem to be dead now? I figured it was dead but then I read Fansided saying the Yankees had promising talks with the Cubs recently. Please tell me Cubs are keeping him for the season.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Never felt Hoerner was likely to go, given how much he means to the 2026 roster when they’re clearly pushing to win now. I’d be shocked to see him traded this year.

====================

SPEAKER: TxDude
---
Thoughts on the Rangers offense? I feel like it has to be improved almost by default

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don’t think it’s great, but I agree that it’ll be better than last year. Feels like a middle-of-the-pack group to me. Not much faith in Jansen, Smith or Burger providing a ton, and I’ve begun to sour on Josh Jung.But Nimmo-Langford-Seager is a really talented trio, and there’s just no way Joc is as bad as he was last year

====================

SPEAKER: I know Jack
---
Would I be way off base to predict Detroit being this yrs Rangers, All Pitch No Hit?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I think each of Colt Keith, Riley Greene, Gleyber Torres, Spencer Torkelson, Kerry Carpenter (against righties) and Dillon Dingler can be above-average hitters, and they’ve got Kevin McGonigle and Max Anderson hustling toward the majors.So, while I would have liked them to add another bat, I also think you’re looking at comfortably better offense than the Rangers got last year

====================

SPEAKER: Buster
---
DO you think the Giants have done enough for a return to postseason play this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I do not Bullpen is bad. Rotation is exceptionally top-heavy.

====================

SPEAKER: Prince
---
Which Dbacks hitter is primed to break out this year, Jordan Lawlar, Alek Thomas or Pavin Smith?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Give me Lawlar among the three.I don’t think Smith really “needs” a breakout. He kind of is what he is. He can beat up right-handed pitching but needs a platoon partner. He’s a useful player, but it sure seems like Arizona fans have other views on him based on these chats, haha

====================

SPEAKER: Ludwig’s New Glove
---
In all the moves the Braves DIDNT make, I am all the more perplexed at extending Sale. This maddening. Does this move make sense in the absence of no other starting pitching moves?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don’t think the lack of additions is especially related to this extension. The Sale deal impacts the 2027 roster.The Braves, to me, feel like they were bullish on Schwellenbach, Waldrep and some other in-house guys, spent their money elsewhere, and now don’t have much financial breathing room to add in the wake of those surgeries.

====================

SPEAKER: Twins Fan
---
Emmanuel Rodriguez should be on the Twins roster on Opening Day. Agree or disagree?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Eh, he’s only 22 and has minimal AAA experience, where he K’ed at a 32% clip. He’s always going to K a lot, which is fine, because he walks SO much and has so much power, but I’d want to see him at least curb the K’s a bit in AAA.I imagine you’re looking at Wallner in one OF corner. They should have non-tendered Trevor Larnach, though maybe they can trade him to a team seeking a LH OF (hi Astros!) and then give a look to Alan Roden in LF while Rodriguez keeps working in St. Paul.Regardless, his MLB debut will be this year as long as he’s healthy (which is no small caveat for Rodriguez)

====================

SPEAKER: Sam_Horn_Legendary_Slugger
---
Grichuk signing anywhere? Royals make sense?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Think they view that as Lane Thomas’ role. I could see the Yankees or Cardinals. Twins have like 100 LH OFs and don’t really have someone filling the role Bader did last year. (I guess Austin Martin, kind of)

====================

SPEAKER: Josh E
---
Do you think the padres are getting ready to trade Sheets?  Seems they have alot of guys that can do the first base/dh/corner outfield (in a pinch) job and Sheets might be the only one with any trade value.  If so, what are they trading for?  Pitching??

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don’t really think that, no. He’s easily their best LHH option at first base and really one of the only three LHH bats on whom they can rely for above-average production. You hope you get that from Song, but no way to know yet. Alright, I’ve got to wrap up for the week.
