SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s Sunday night and time to chat! We’ll launch things after the queue starts to fill up…

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony
---
Tucker and Imai for the Yanks?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’d be surprised to see New York spend to quite that level in bringing in two top-level guys.  Bellinger and Imai seem like a more reasonable duo, if the Yankees make two big purchases

====================

SPEAKER: Rhett lowder
---
Am I eligible for rookie of the year? I am under the innings limit but have over a year of service time on the 60 day IL.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Lowder is no longer considered a rookie

====================

SPEAKER: AstroFAN
---
Could Tyler Mahle go to Houston?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Seems like a reasonable fit.  Bringing in another guy with a recent injury history might not be entirely ideal for an Astros team that wants to cover innings, but Mahle on a one-year works with the budget

====================

SPEAKER: Chase
---
How can the Phillies be both prioritizing re-signing Schwarber  AND be far apart on years and money? He’s seen this organization wildly overpay Trea Turner and Aaron Nola. Why shouldn’t he get the same? Pay the man.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Todd Zolecki’s report from the other day didn’t say anything about Schwarber and the Phillies being “far apart” in anything, necessarily.  He said that they’re “not close to a deal,’ which would relate to some kind of a gap in negotiations, or maybe just a timing issue. Consider this scenario…..Dave Dombrowski says “Kyle, you know how much we want you back.  Take your time looking around the market, and all we ask is that you give us a chance to match any offer.”

====================

SPEAKER: Jerry Dipoto
---
Could we re-sign Polanco and Geno? Which of the 2 is more likely

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Polanco seems a lot more likely, as a fit for what the Mariners want to achieve

====================

SPEAKER: Ms Fan
---
I read the MLBTR piece on internal infield options for the Mariners. Other than potentially reuniting with Suarez or Polanco, what realistic external options exist for the team?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Interesting question, since haven’t heard much of anything about Seattle’s offseason targets apart from their own guys (i.e. Naylor and Polanco).  Obviously Dipoto and his staff haven’t been idle in checking around for other options, but chances are Polanco is the top priority, and other infield adds won’t be explored more deeply until Polanco is off the board

====================

SPEAKER: Jeremy
---
Could the orioles extend Dylan beavers or Trevor Rogers?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Beavers is probably the likelier candidate for an extension, since Rogers is close enough to free agency that he’d probably want to check out the open market.  If he duplicates his 2025 numbers, he’ll be in for a big payday next winter

====================

SPEAKER: Brewers Fan
---
Was very surprised that a Miz extension would even be mentioned, what do you think an extension like that would look like? Seems a little risky for the Brewers no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Locking up a young potential ace is a very logical tactic for a lower-payroll team.  If the Brewers feel as strongly about the Miz’s future as they did Chourio, they could explore another long-term deal that extends the team’s control over the hurler

====================

SPEAKER: fprex
---
What is the market for the Braves’ Sean Murphy? I’d imagine SD would be interested and Texas should be as well. Could the Braves get Seager to waive his no-trade clause and work a deal around Murphy?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Despite Murphy’s recent numbers, he would get interest if Atlanta shopped him, just because the catching market is so thin.  But having Murphy as any kind of a centerpiece of a potential Seager trade is a real reach.

====================

SPEAKER: Redbeard
---
Pirates actually gonna spend money or all bluster?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’ll believe it when I see it, but there has been enough smoke about the Pirates spending that I feel they’ll do something out of character.  Not sign Schwarber anything, but they’ll sign a position player to a fairly pricey (for them) multi-year contract.  Skenes has established himself as such a star that it seems like the Bucs really want to win something while he’s still in the organization.

====================

SPEAKER: Getz
---
Does the same agent representing multiple players impact the timing of signings? Like does an agent prioritize the “big fish” first and slow play negotiations for the secondary free agents they represent that play the same position?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It makes for a fascinating question, but I doubt any agent would really go on the record about how they operate in any given offseason.  No agent wants to even slightly give the impression that one client is more value than another.Since each player is different, an agent has flexibility in how they deal with each situation, even in the bigger-picture context of an offseason where an agency has multiple clients.

====================

SPEAKER: Jorge Soler
---
Do the pirates make sense as a team considering they need to increase payroll?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
In theory, but I’d think (hope?) the Pirates would be aiming higher than an aging hitter coming off a subpar year

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Why does mlb free agency take much longer for players than other major sports

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Other leagues have salary caps, and rigid caps in the case of the NFL and NHL.  With only a certain amount of flexibility, players and teams want to get everything done quickly in order to move onto other business, which is why the first day of free agency in other sports is just an avalanche of moves

====================

SPEAKER: Phils Phan
---
Would it make any sense for the Phillies to say goodbye to Schwarber and Realmuto and to trade Casty for a bag of beans but eat half his salary? This way they could get younger. Target younger free agents. I’m I crazy or is thus feasible?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If Realmuto leaves, that’s a big hole to fill at catcher.  It is highly unlikely the Phillies find someone willing to take a quarter (let alone half) of Castellanos’ salary.  Schwarber is replaceable in the sense that you can get another big bat at another position and it opens up the DH spot, but that’s a big loss to the clubhouse.Your take that the Phillies should get younger isn’t inaccurate, but sticking with known quantities is the safer move for a team that wants to win now.  Who knows, maybe Dombrowski will swing some clever trade for a catcher and Realmuto isn’t brought back, but that’s a less likely scenario.

====================

SPEAKER: Casey
---
What do you think of Buster Olney’s report that the Giants won’t spend on a top of the rotation arm and are really looking for value middle of the rotation guys? Giants seem to have money and a significant need for pitching.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Robbie Ray is a free agent after next season, too.  So signing another pitcher to a longer-term deal to pair with Webb atop the post-Ray rotation seems sound.But, even though Farhan Zaidi is gone, the Giants are sticking with their reluctance to give any kind of significantly lengthy deal to a pitcher.  Their logic isn’t unsound, yet sometimes if you need a pitcher, you have to throw caution to the wind

====================

SPEAKER: Alex
---
Diamondbacks need at LEAST three starters right? Do we think they make a splash? Or go mid range?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Mid-range.  They already made their big splash with the Burnes signing

====================

SPEAKER: JT
---
The rumor is that Miami is trying to take on more salary to gain more favor in revenue sharing. As a Red Sox fan, I would selfishly love them to take on the Yoshida deal and maybe add Florida’s own Triston Casas to sweeten the deal. What other contracts do you see as potential fits if they struggle to attract free agents or their own?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Since the A’s were in this same situation last winter, we can use them as something of a model for what Miami might do.The A’s signed Severino, gave Leclerc $10MM, and extended Rooker and Butler to significant long-term deals.  What they didn’t do (and I don’t think the Marlins will do) is become a way station for other teams’ unwanted contracts.Your Red Sox hypothetical is also flawed on Boston’s end, since I think the Sox would want a lot more in a Casas trade than to just use him as salary relief.

====================

SPEAKER: HOF Hater
---
If Donny Baseball gets into the Hall, it would open the door for so many players with goodish careers. Look at Josh Donaldson’s numbers basically the same if not better then Mattingly. Would you support a Donaldson for the HOF push?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Nope, nor would I vote for Mattingly if I had a spot on this year’s veterans committee.  Mattingly had a fine career but his prime was so short that he doesn’t reach my personal HOF threshold.Hey wait, is it too late for me to be part of the veterans committee?  Who do I need to speak to at Cooperstown to make this happen?!

====================

SPEAKER: Blue Jays fan
---
Max Schrezer and Chris Bassitt both sounded like they wanted to come back to Toronto and try to win the World Series next year. Does the Cease signing close the door on this?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Right now Toronto’s rotation is Gausman, Cease, Bieber, Yesavage, and Berrios.  So technically there’s no room, unless perhaps Berrios is dealt or if Bassitt or Scherzer is willing to transition into a relief/swingman role.  (Conceivably, Berrios might also take on such a role.) While the door isn’t entirely closed, it makes it a lot less likely

====================

SPEAKER: Zane
---
Do you see CJ Abrams as a trade piece this offseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Anthony Franco recently did a nice breakdown of a possible CJA trade market, so here’s the link to that post:https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/11/looking-for-a-match-in-a-cj-abr… I think Abrams is ultimately still in DC on Opening Day, but the Nationals won’t be married to the idea of keeping him if a good offer comes along

====================

SPEAKER: Rod
---
Could the Yankees possibly try and trade for the Twins Joe Ryan?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Sure, that definitely seems like something the Yankees could or should attempt.  Ryan is a good add for any team in baseball, but to that end, the Twins will require a ton before dealing him.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Would a Blue Jays’ package of Ernie Clement, King, and Tiedemann get a Marte deal done?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Diamondbacks would want more.  Plus, I doubt the Jays move Clement given his infield value and what he showed at the plate last year.My friend Melanie is also hoping for a Clement jersey for Christmas, so if a trade does happen, hopefully it takes place before Mel’s partner plunks down a big chunk of change on suddenly outdated merch

====================

SPEAKER: confused
---
If the catcher market is thin, could you see the Brewers moving Contreras and his approx $11mill salary?  What kind or return could he possibly bring?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Same logic as the Phillies and Realmuto earlier….if you get a starting catcher go, what’s your plan to replace him?  Trading Contreras is even less likely for the Brewers since he’s affordable for them even for that salary, since it’s still a bargain price for such a productive catcher You’ll start to hear more trade buzz about Contreras next winter when he’s a year away from free agency.  It will be interesting to see if Milwaukee is sold enough on Quero to trade Contreras, or if they’ll hang onto him to try and win in 2027, then let him walk in free agency

====================

SPEAKER: Al Kaline Battery
---
Verlander to the Tigers. Unfinished business and added motivation. Is it plausible?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s certainly plausible.  The Tigers don’t want to stretch payroll too much, but bringing back Verlander on a one-year deal would be both popular with the fanbase, and a logical baseball move given how JV was still a solid pitcher in 2025

====================

SPEAKER: Chaim Bloom
---
Should I bring in Scherzer on a one year deal?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Scherzer wants to pitch for a contender, not a rebuilding team Unless his market is completely barren, I don’t see Scherzer going to St. Louis

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P’s Long Lost Brother
---
Who’s an underrated free agent right now more people should be talking about?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He’s not “underrated,” and maybe this is just because I’m higher on him than most.  But there’s been a lack of public buzz about Ranger Suarez to date, which I find curious.

====================

SPEAKER: Oz
---
Are the Braves seriously shopping Sean Murphy or is this a case of just listening in case someone bowls them over with an offer?  a

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There have been trade rumblings about Murphy basically since Drake Baldwin starting breaking out, but it’s more speculative than based on any concrete info.  Of course, the Braves run such a tight ship that not much leaks from their front office anyway, but generally, the Murphy buzz is more speculative from Atlanta fans thinking of ways to free up payroll space and move a (possibly) redundant player

====================

SPEAKER: Adley Rutschman
---
Cal Raleigh signed a 6/$105MM prior to his 2025 MVP-runner-up season and now the deal suddenly looks like a bargain. What kind of extension should I accept, if offered?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Rutschman isn’t an extension candidate, in my view.  From his perspective, a contract he signs now will be too low, since Adley obviously feels he can top his 2024-25 numbers.  From the Orioles’ perspective, why rush to extend a catcher whose numbers for the last season and a half have been so underwhelming?  Especially when Baltimore already locked up Basallo?

====================

SPEAKER: fascinating
---
I don’t buy Olney’s report of the Giants not spending on big free agent pitchers. What is the logic in trading for Devers and then making a huge managerial change only to be tight with money? Is the looming CBA fight have any relevance?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Giants’ stance is that they’re reluctant to invest in long-term deals with pitchers.  With position players, it’s a different story, as we’ve seen with Adames, Chapman, and the Devers trade

====================

SPEAKER: O’s Fan
---
Are you a Coby Mayo believer? I can’t figure out why the heck Baltimore tendered Mountcastle a contract.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I was also surprised, but tendering Mountcastle was perhaps a middle ground between a) entrusting Mayo with the everyday 1B job, or b) going big on acquiring another starting first baseman.

====================

SPEAKER: Walter
---
Last year before the Josh Naylor trade, the Guardians were interested  in Paul Goldschimdt before he decided on the Yankees.  Since the Guardians still need a right hand bat would they consider him this off season.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s a possible fit, but it’s also very possible Cleveland’s interest has cooled after Goldschmidt’s average season

====================

SPEAKER: Mike
---
Could you see the Marlins/Pirates making a trade purely to up the payroll, if they aren’t able to actually sign anyone they want and don’t want the grievance? Like take on Castellanos’ salary and get a prospect for it, then just DFA Castellanos? Neither org is well thought of so isn’t it possible that they can’t sign anybody and end up in a really bad spot payroll-wise and have to make a move?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If the Marlins/Pirates offer enough money, they can definitely get people to sign.  The price was right for Severino to join the A’s last year, as much as he might regret that decision in hindsight.And, who’s to say a free agent wouldn’t have interest in either team.  The Marlins were a decent team last year that seems to be on the way up, and they play in Florida.  The Pirates have Skenes and a bunch of good pitchers, so a prominent free agent might be intrigued by the challenge of bringing winning baseball back to Pittsburgh

====================

SPEAKER: nick krall
---
could i potentially sign marcell ozuna as a cheaper alternative to kyle schwarber? and or ryan ohearn could work for this question too.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
O’Hearn would be my preference, as Ozuna is basically a DH-only guy but O’Hearn has defensive utility.  Plus, a lefty bat is better fit for Cincy’s lineup.

====================

SPEAKER: Ca$hman
---
what do you think about a franchise player designation in the next cba that either discounts that players lux tax hit by a certain percentage for high spending teams, or the lux tax going to pay a certain percentage of a franchise players salary for revenue sharing recipients?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Creative answers like this seem way more feasible to me than the idea of the players ever agreeing to a salary cap.  The NBA version of your idea is somewhat akin to the “Larry Bird rule,” which allows a team to go over the cap in order to retain its own free agent.

====================

SPEAKER: Blue
---
How do you like Imai wanted to take down the Dodgers? I dont think he will be popular in Japan now.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I don’t see his comments making too much of a stir.  Seems like a perfectly logical thing a competitive person would say

====================

SPEAKER: WBC
---
Thoughts on the World Baseball Classic?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Of all the hundreds of baseball games I’ve attended in person, the 2009 WBC tilt in Toronto remains one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had.

====================

SPEAKER: Oppo nacho
---
What’s the most plausible bat the reds sign or trade for

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The previous commenter’s suggestion of O’Hearn is pretty plausible, actually.  I imagine ROH will get a lot of looks from teams in the medium payroll range who can’t afford the likes of a Schwarber or an Alonso

====================

SPEAKER: Funnyball
---
Any insight into what DePosesta may do to turn the Rockies around? What do you think of them taking on a bad contract in order to add a little talent to the org.  Say Yoshida or Contreras plus prospects?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Neither Contreras is a bad contract, but in general, your point makes sense.  The Rockies are basically starting from scratch here and don’t really have anything on the books besides Tovar and Bryant.  Who knows if ownership would sign off or not, but taking on Yoshida/Castellanos/etc. just to obtain much-needed prospects is a decent strategy for a team with a sparse farm system

====================

SPEAKER: MCM
---
Lots of new managers coming. Anyone you’re particularly excited about?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Obvious answer here is Tony Vitello, just because he’s such a unique hire.  It’ll be fascinating to see how his work at Tennessee can translate to working with big leaguers.

====================

SPEAKER: Joe
---
Do you think there’s more to the Ryan Helsley deal than what’s been reported? 2/28M with an opt out seems higher than expected; maybe because there’s a club option for 2028 if he opts in or it’s backloaded a bit?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
No reports yet on how the $28MM is allotted over the two seasons.  No club option was reported so that’s not part of things.I don’t think $28MM is too outlandish for Helsley.  He had a brutal run with the Mets, but if that really was just due to tipping pitches, that’s a fixable problem.

====================

SPEAKER: kurt the hurt
---
How do you like the new Ball/Strike challange system coming next season ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think it only benefits the game to have a backup against correctable mistakes.  In the same way that replays and challenges have improved games, getting to fix a few ball/strike calls per game sounds like a good thing to me

====================

SPEAKER: Kyle
---
Do you think Gray ends up being Boston’s only SP addition this offseason, and if so how do you think they address the outfield surplus?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I suspect they’re not done in the rotation.

====================

SPEAKER: Who Hangs Up?
---
Skenes to the Yankees for… The Martian, Austin Wells, Schlitter, Spencer Jones, George Lombard Jr.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If the Yankees actually offered all that for Skenes, I think Pittsburgh says yes

====================

SPEAKER: John Son
---
Are the Reds going to have a competition for the 3b job, or have they already given it to Hayes? Where does Sal Stewart fit if Hayes is the 3b and Steer at 1b? Stewart just the DH?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Hayes is an incredible defensive 3B, so he isn’t going anywhere.  As recently noted in an Athletic piece, Stewart/Steer have enough positional flexibility that it allows the Reds to be open to several possibilities as they weigh new additionshttps://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/11/reds-notes-lineup-free-agent-pu…

====================

SPEAKER: Chris Young
---
Do you think I sign one of the big name free agents?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Rangers seem to be cutting payroll, and not getting into position to make any splashy new signings

====================

SPEAKER: Guardians of the Galaxy
---
Who is going to play 2B for Cleveland in 2026? Do you think Bazzana can break camp with the team?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Though Bazzana made it to Triple-A last year, I suspect the Guardians want to see more from him on the batting average and power fronts before giving him a look in the Show.That being said, I’d be very surprised if Bazzana doesn’t get the call before 2026 is out.  This might also be a situation where Bazzana is on the Opening Day roster if the Guardians can sign him to a pre-career extension

====================

SPEAKER: Robbie Baseball
---
Do you think Addison Barger is somewhat “untouchable” at this point (outside of something major)?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Tend to agree.  It would be a big surprise if Barger is dealt in the wake of his breakout year

====================

SPEAKER: Drew
---
Do you expect that Breslow and Toboni will line up on some trades?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Boston fans started thinking of Gore trades the minute Toboni got hired.  It’s certainly possible the Sox and Nats make some trades given Toboni’s knowledge of the Boston farm system, but not necessarily any big blockbuster-ish moves

====================

SPEAKER: Cubs
---
Tatsuya Imai and Cubs a good fit?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Sure.  Raises the ceiling of Chicago’s rotation, and provides long-term rotation help since Imanaga/Taillon/Boyd are all free agents after 2026

====================

SPEAKER: mark
---
Could cards balance a trade with M,s featuring Donovan & Sloan as principals

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If Polanco departs, trading for Donovan would be a very nice pivot for Seattle.  Dealing Sloan for two years of Donovan is a risk, yet the M’s farm system is deep enough that Dipoto might be willing to take the plunge.

====================

SPEAKER: Mariners Fan
---
Do you think there is a market for Luis Castillo? Does it make sense to trade him? It would free up money, but create a hole in the pitching staff.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s certainly a market for him. Ownership seems to be a little more willing to spend given how close the team came in 2025, so the idea of moving Castillo just to open up payroll space might not be as critical as it once seemed.  And you’re right, trading Castillo does mean the M’s now need another starter to either step up from the minors, or they could acquire a low-cost vet.

====================

SPEAKER: Dana Brown 4 Advice
---
Should I sign Merrill Kelly?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The “Dana Brown 4 Advice” poster sent in like a dozen questions all about various players, so I feel compelled to answer at least one.  I chose an option that seemed most realistic, as Kelly fits within the Astros’ budget and he’d be a nice help for the rotation.btw, I have my suspicions that the poster isn’t the actual Dana Brown

====================

SPEAKER: secret souse
---
Will White Sox convince OHearn with some money doing the talking? I could see him being unpopular with MLB analytic departments and maybe his price is 1y/15m plus buyout on a second year. He doesn’t have the long track record, though he’s ok with the bat data

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
We had two years, $26MM for O’Hearn in the top 50 list. As noted earlier, he’ll get enough interest that ROH will probably find an acceptable offer with a team that has better chance of winning in 2026 than the White Sox

====================

SPEAKER: fascinating
---
favorite movie of 2025?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“Sinners” is the best I’ve seen this year.  Fantastic film!

====================

SPEAKER: Cards Fan
---
When will the 2026 mlb draft order be determined? Where will the cards pick??

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The lottery takes place on December 9

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
With this possibly being the last year for Skubal and Torres for the Tigers, do you see a chance the Tigers going all in this  year and signing combination of Framber Valdéz or Ranger Suarez and either Bregman or Bichette.  Skubal and Torres would come off the books the following year and they would already have their replacements on the team.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This seems bolder than the Tigers are willing to be, even though I absolutely agree they should be making the most of Skubal’s (probable) last season in Detroit.  Making at least one big-time signing seems more than reasonable for a team that has been in contention for two straight years now, but is still a few pieces away We’re over two hours now, so time to wrap up the chat.  Thanks for all your questions tonight, and next week, the Weekend Chat will probably be taking place during the day on Saturday.
