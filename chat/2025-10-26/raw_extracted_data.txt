SPEAKER: Mark P

The Weekend Chat is upon us!  We’ll wait a minute for the questions to start piling up, then get cracking….

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Reds trading front of line pitcher this off-season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If by “front of the line” you mean Greene, Abbott, or Lodolo, probably not.  Petty and Burns likely aren’t going anywhere either, so Singer might be the most realistic starter Cincinnati would deal to obtain some real hitting help

====================

SPEAKER: Angela
---
Want do you see the phillies  doing this off-season

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Well, my outlook on the Phillies offseason could be summed up as….https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2025/10/offseason-outlook-philadelphia-… The TL;DR version is that my guess is that the Phils re-sign Schwarber and Realmuto, Suarez departs, Bohm is non-tendered or traded, and the team brings in a significant everyday outfielder to replace Castellanos (who will probably be released, in lieu of a salary-dump trade) Now, whether or not this “significant everyday outfielder” is more of a stopgap or, say, Kyle Tucker or someone more eye-opening remains to be seen

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Does Luis Arraez make more or less than 12 million AAV in free agency?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Less.  I admit that Arraez is a tricky player to evaluate, but most modern front offices will look at his lack of defensive utility and lack of overall offensive production rather than just his batting averages

====================

SPEAKER: Jonny Venters
---
You’re the GM of the Pirates, and Bob Nutting has told you he intends to raise the payroll as high as $210 million in 2026(don’t laugh!).  What moves do you make this offseason to put PIT in contention?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
First I get up off the ground, since that news would’ve caused me to faint.Then, heck, sign Tucker, sign Schwarber, go all out on bats.

====================

SPEAKER: Dan
---
Who do you believe is the favorite to be the next Braves manager?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Braves are purposely keeping news quiet, but Mark Bowman of MLB.com had an interesting report the other day pointing towards Danny Lehmann as a name under increasingly serious consideration.Hard to call Lehmann the “favorite,” per se, but given the lack of other names, I guess it’s maybe him by default?  Just as notably, Bowman reported that guys like Ross, DeRosa, and Gibbons weren’t being considered

====================

SPEAKER: Doug
---
Should the Mets be engaging the Rays in trade talks this offseason? The Rays can offer short-term bullpen help (Fairbanks), as well as offense at 2B (Lowe) and/or 1B (Yandy Diaz) that wouldn’t require Stearns to go long-term on any of those players (and likely not impact the top of the farm system prospects). What would be a framework of a potential deal between the Mets and Rays?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Rays tend to want at least one MLB-ready player in such a notable trade, so they’d ask for one of the Mets’ young starters.  This might not necessarily work for a NYM team that needs rotation depth anyway, but to your point, Tampa combining two of their trade chips into a single deal might be intriguing on this front.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
What routes do you see the Red Sox taking? I feel there are a million different ways they could go. I feel signing Tucker then trading both Duran and Abreu in two different trades for pitching is the way to go.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This seems a touch complicated when the Sox could just trade one OF for a pitcher, and then perhaps sign another arm.  Tucker probably won’t be on Boston’s radar when the Sox already have so much in the outfield pipeline.

====================

SPEAKER: C-Daddy
---
Stress level out of 10 with your beloved Blue Jays in the playoffs.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Oh man, I’ve been a borderline nervous wreck all October, lol.  Playoff baseball is both the best and kinda the worst!My stress level is somewhat mitigated by my amazement that the Blue Jays actually won the pennant and are battling it out in the WS.  Obviously it would be disappointing to get this close and then fall short, but this whole season has been such an unexpected joy that it’s all gravy at this point.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark
---
Do you think that Mike Trout is going to be traded?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
No

====================

SPEAKER: Chaim Bloom
---
Who should I go after in free agency, but also remain in rebuild territory?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Cardinals’ free agent targets will probably be veterans on one-year deals, with the idea being that St. Louis could then potentially flip them at the deadline.  They don’t want to block any of their young players to any great extent, but signing a starting pitcher to eat innings and act as an experienced leader for the kids makes sense, especially if Gray is moved

====================

SPEAKER: Allen
---
Seattle needs a bat for 2B/3B and are said to be shopping Castillo. Who are the top targets? Might they pay some salary?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The M’s might still be open to moving Castillo to free up some payroll space, yet don’t forget that Colt Emerson will be making his MLB next year.  It’s probably safe to pencil him in at 2B or 3B, leaving the Mariners looking at just the other position.  It could be as simply as re-signing Polanco, if they think he’ll be able to return to regular second base action

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
A lot of Giants fans want them to pursue Skubal in light of trade rumors that he’ll be made available. But I say wait til he’s FA and take a run at him then, otherwise you spend all your trade capital on someone who will walk at the end of 2026 cause he’s a Boras guy and Boras discourages extensions.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This makes sense, though having Skubal on the roster for a year and (in theory) winning him over with the organizational atmosphere and the Giants’ intent to win will help them in a bidding war next winter.  Not that Skubal would necessarily be taking a hometown discount or anything, maybe he’d be more open to staying in a known environment if the money is pretty equal all around

====================

SPEAKER: Ang T
---
IF Harper made available for trade by PHI, which teams would be the top suitors?

====================

SPEAKER: Dave Dombrowski
---
What CF could I get for Bryce Harper on the trade market after my idiotic comments about him after the season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“Idiotic” is the wrong word.  I’ll bet Dombrowski wishes he’d phrased his answer differently in that press conference, but Dombrowski said nothing incorrect about Harper’s 2025 season.  I can also understand why a competitive guy like Harper would be upset by the comments, plus the fact that Dombrowski didn’t mention the obvious caveat that Harper was dealing with a wrist problem for a decent chunk of the year.This seems like much ado about nothing, ultimately, in part because Harper has a no-trade clause and doesn’t want to go anywhere.  If Dombrowsk was playing 4-D chess and Harper now has extra motivation to have another MVP-level season, everyone wins.

====================

SPEAKER: Ghost
---
What would a reasonable offseason look like for the White Sox to try to progress towards respectability?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Getting a good return in a Luis Robert trade. Picking up a couple of other veterans that turn into good deadline trade chips.  If the White Sox were ever willing to spend money, I’d suggest taking on a bad contract or two in order to try and obtain some better prospects from teams.

====================

SPEAKER: Natitude Dude
---
Alec Bohm to the Nats to play 1B/3B? Thoughts.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Bohm is a free agent next winter, so I don’t think he’s much of a fit on a Nationals team that likely isn’t trying to win in 2026.

====================

SPEAKER: Rays Days
---
If there is a 2027 work stoppage or lockoutWould it behoove the rays to just pick up Lowe’s and  Diaz’s options for next year and then wait and see what 2027 brings

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Lowe has a club option for 2026, whereas Diaz is under contract next year (with a club option for 2027).Sure, it’s possible the Rays might just stand pat with both guys.  Fairbanks is the most obvious trade candidate of the three, so he’s the only one I’d be truly surprised to see still in a Rays uniform on Opening Day.  The Rays might want to keep Lowe and Yandy around to help a lineup that needs more pop anyway.

====================

SPEAKER: Tennessee fan
---
Does the Vitello hiring make the Giants a more desirable destination seeing that Vitello’s recruiting skills have reportedly been outstanding?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This is an interesting aspect of Vitello’s hiring that I haven’t seen addressed in much depth.  The Giants’ issues in luring (most) top free agents to San Francisco have been well-documented, yet keep in mind, there’s a world of difference between talking a top high schooler or college player into coming to Tennessee and talking a top free agent into signing with your team. Ultimately it’ll come down to what the Giants are offering financially, of course, but if they’re offering comparable money, maybe a great pitch from Vitello could be a tie-breaker in some cases.

====================

SPEAKER: John Stanton
---
Everyone in Seattle loves Naylor. Should I just give him want he wants to stay and play for us or is this just the Naylor charm talking and my money could be better spent elsewhere?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If Naylor doesn’t re-sign, the Mariners will need a first baseman anyway.  So why not go all-in (to some extent) to bring back a known quantity who has already proven that he can hit in Seattle?

====================

SPEAKER: Trip
---
Where do you see Freddy Peralta next year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
On Opening Day, Freddy Peralta will be playing for….The Brewers(27.7% | 102 votes)Another team(72.2% | 265 votes)Total Votes: 367 I totally see the logic in trading Peralta, but I’d lean more towards him staying put.  The fact that Peralta is making just $8MM is such a big help to the Brewers’ budget and their rotation that it would be a really huge offer to get Arnold to pull the trigger on a deal.

====================

SPEAKER: Drew
---
Who are you hearing will be the Padres next manager?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Based just on speculation, my guess is Ryan Flaherty.  A known quantity in SD, and he was apparently Preller’s preferred choice in the last managerial search before he was overruled by upper management.

====================

SPEAKER: White Sox Fan
---
What would Tyler Soderstrom cost in a trade? Sox need some power bats. I also can see Rhys Hoskins as a good fit on a 1 yesr deal

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Signing Hoskins is a far, far likelier scenario than the A’s dealing away a controllable talent like Soderstrom.  The LF experiment with Soderstrom worked out far better than expected, so the A’s suddenly have no logjam between him, Rooker, and Kurtz

====================

SPEAKER: Dodger Fan
---
Do you think the Dodgers will go out and get some OF help this offseason or give one of their young minor league studs a chance to come up and play LF?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
You can’t rule LA out on a big signing like Tucker just because they’re one of the few teams in that spending tier.  But, I can see the Dodgers being a bit cagier and looking to add an outfielder who is controlled just for 2026.  Perhaps a Conforto-esque free agent on a one-year deal, except obviously with the hope that this player produces way more than Conforto did

====================

SPEAKER: Gussie Busch
---
Where do the Cards start? Fire sale and see what’s left? Not sure the fan base will give it 3 years. The past two generations of fans have never experienced this.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
You’re selling the STL fans short, since there have been tons of questions/comments in these chats alone over the last few years from Cardinals supporters wanting to blow things up.  A rebuild is at least a direction, rather than the team spending 2024-25 largely treading water.

====================

SPEAKER: Marky Mark
---
Whats on the Playlist tonight?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Dolores O’Riordan’s cover of “Go Your Own Way”

====================

SPEAKER: bmcferren
---
Are the Cubs willing to take on salary to trade Ian Happ? Is Happ willing to waive his no trade clause to play left field in hometown of Pittsburgh?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Happ is making $18MM, and he is coming off a very solid year.  The Cubs probably don’t feel they should have to take on money in any trade, plus Happ probably won’t be too keen on waiving his no-trade protection.  And, if he is, it’s hard to see him leaving a contender to join the woeful Bucs (hometown pride notwithstanding)

====================

SPEAKER: Miguel Andujar
---
Does it make sense for me to come back to the Yankees to help Judge win a championship?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Andujar is one of the free agents I see as a great low-key add for a lot of teams.  Not sure he’s an ideal fit for the Yankees specifically unless they kept him in LF full-time, not to mention any bad blood that might exist between the two sides

====================

SPEAKER: A. A.
---
Texas needs to shed salary, but needs a catcher. We need a shortstop. How conceivable is a deal built around Sean Murphy and Corey Seager

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
With like $140MM of a gap in salaries between the two, this doesn’t seem very realistic.  Seager is terrific when he’s healthy, but teams would be very wary about his ability to stay off the IL over the course of his contract.  Perhaps especially if you’re a Braves team that was crushed by injuries last year, this doesn’t seem like a fit.

====================

SPEAKER: Sharon Peters
---
clayton kershaw starting a World Series game yes or no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Kershaw isn’t better right now than any of Yamamoto, Glasnow, Ohtani, or Snell, so no.

====================

SPEAKER: Moreno-gels
---
is there any hope for the Angels to add any talent this offseason??  Or just another year of losing records and wasting Mike Trout?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not to be pessimistic before the Angels’ offseason has really gotten underway, but I find it hard to see that team competing in 2026.  We’ve already gotten the weirdness of the managerial search and Suzuki getting just a one-year contract, so things are already off to a strange start for the team.

====================

SPEAKER: Reds Hopeful
---
Brady Singer for Wilyer Abreu as the two main pieces make sense for both teams?  I like Abreu in Cincy better than what it would take to get Duran. Seems like a better candidate to hit 30 HRs too.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Singer is a free agent next winter, so the Red Sox would want a more controllable pitcher if they’re giving up Abreu

====================

SPEAKER: silent george
---
is schwelenbach expected back full go by spring training? any long term worries with that injury or just a fluke thing?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Schwellenbach was getting ready to start throwing again even before the 2025 season was over, so he should be ready to roll for the start of spring camp

====================

SPEAKER: PCM2013
---
How much does Boston want to move off Masataka Yoshida (if at all)? Would they consider a Yoshida-Taijuan Walker bad contract swap? Feels like a move to the other team’s stadium could help both players – Fenway helping Walker’s flyball stay in the yard, and CPB helping Yoshida’s power numbers.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Yoshida is owed $36MM over the next two seasons, and Walker is owed $18MM for 2026.  So there’s a financial gap right there, plus Walker posted decent numbers in 2025 and showed that he could again operate as a competent Major League starter.Yoshida, meanwhile, missed most of the season due to injury and didn’t hit well when he returned to action.  For the Phillies in particular, adding Yoshida to a lineup that hopes to have Schwarber back at DH isn’t a fit whatsoever.

====================

SPEAKER: Bob
---
Do the Marlins make playoffs? with there young core

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s optimistic to view Miami as a playoff team right now, but it can’t be ruled out given how much progress they made in 2025.  A few canny moves this winter might well put the Fish right into the playoff picture.

====================

SPEAKER: LAD
---
Can you see a scenario in which LAD sits out the offseason?  They’ve got a stable of top100 OF talent and talk of pursuit of an OF on a long term deal.  A ton of SPs rehabbing in the minors and a pen that needs a remake.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
You said it yourself, the bullpen needs enough work that the Dodgers won’t be sitting anything out.  But in general, obviously LA is in a lot better overall shape than most teams, so I wouldn’t expect a ton of blockbuster moves.  (One blockbuster move, however? Sure.)

====================

SPEAKER: Chief
---
It appears the Royals are going to count on Caglianone to take a big role in 2026. Your thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As a top prospect, KC isn’t going to give up on him this soon, naturally.  Some more time at Triple-A seems like it might help to get Caglianone’s confidence back a bit, and adding another outfielder or two lessens the pressure on Caglianone to be good immediately.

====================

SPEAKER: Bader
---
Phillies will top any offer I get in FA right? They need my exact skill set

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As well as Bader performed in Philly, two months of production isn’t too likely to overwhelm his previous few years of subpar hitting.  The Phils surely have some interest in bringing him back, but not at any price

====================

SPEAKER: Phillies guy
---
Bohm and Castellanos to angels for Ward and Soler   Who says no

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This exact deal seems like the Phillies benefit a lot more than the Halos, so it needs some tweaking.

====================

SPEAKER: Core
---
Do you see a scenario where the Pirates trade Joey Bart? He had a bad year and he can’t field. Henry Davis at every day sounds better plus Rafael Flores and maybe a Shawn Ross. Tell me your thoughts? What do they do if they trade Bart.Call up Shawn Ross.Henry Davis Everyday and flores backup.or Sign a free Agent and let Spring decide Call up Shawn Ross. Henry Davis Everyday and flores backup. or Sign a free Agent and let Spring decide

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
What’s up with the Pirates and all their catchers with two first names?  Henry Davis, Joey Bart, Shawn Ross, Omar Alfonzo, Rafael Flores….well, maybe not that last one, but come on, surely there’s someone in the world with “Flores” as a first nameAnyway, onto the actual question!  I agree that Bart might be moved, as giving Davis another big dose of playing time seems like a more important big-picture decision.

====================

SPEAKER: Ang T
---
Do the TB Rays stay in St. Pete, move to Tampa Proper, or a different location in the future?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
From what I understand of Tampa/St. Pete geography, it seems like having a ballpark in actual Tampa is the much more preferable location for all parties.  It’s just that it seems very difficult to find available land in an area that checks every box the team is looking for, not to mention the finances involved in actually getting the stadium built.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Two Braves notes: 1. Despite how much people like to speculate on a Murphy trade, the Braves have been perfectly fine playing two starter-level catchers alongside each other before. 2. Re: Bowman’s report for Lehmann, while I’m not opposed to him, worth noting that his wording was “his candidacy has seemingly strengthened over the past couple weeks”, and that may be just really mean he thinks Lehmann has a better argument simply because of the Dodgers’ World Series run. At the very least, that part seemed more speculative than other parts apparently backed up by sources.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Anthopoulos has known Lehmann dating back to their days together in LA, so that seems like more of a factor than the Dodgers having another deep playoff run.  Bowman indeed didn’t state that Lehmann was any kind of favorite or even that he was necessarily a top candidate, but it does seem like Lehmann is indeed a candidate.  This is basically all we’ve got to go on given how the Braves are keeping such a tight lid on things.As to your point about the catching situation, it’s also worth noting that Murphy’s trade value isn’t exactly at a high point right now.  If Baldwin continues to hit well and avoids a sophomore slump, Atlanta might look to move Murphy next offseason, but doing so now both leaves the club a bit thin at catcher and it’s a bit of a sell-low on Murphy.

====================

SPEAKER: Tony Rendon
---
Do you think the Angels have any expectations for me in 2026?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If Rendon didn’t have a no-trade clause, he’s actually someone I’d suggest in “bad contract swap” scenarios involving the Angels.  Even if the Halos were taking on more money overall, getting something back in the form of a player that is guaranteed to actually play in 2026 is more preferable to the team than keeping Rendon around One drawback is that Rendon is both owed $38MM in 2026 and that would also be his luxury tax number, which is a bigger hit for teams trying to limit their tax bill

====================

SPEAKER: Kevin in Pa
---
Do starting pitchers like Quintana and Jordan Montgomery make sense for the Cards rotation this season or will they target lesser starters? Thanks

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Both make some sense, though Montgomery is recovering from Tommy John surgery and won’t be back until closer to midseason

====================

SPEAKER: Card Fan 60+ years
---
I remember B Gibson pitching a no-hitter, Torre batting .363, Whitey ball in the eighties. Pujols departing was a major blow, but nothing was like being told we would not compete in 2025. Being told we are losers does not sit in the midwest and I would rather find something else to do than watch.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I don’t doubt that many Cards fans share your opinion, given the lower attendance numbers this season.  But, if the Cards actually had gone ahead with more of a proper rebuild last winter, at least you could’ve said “ok, this stinks, but at least I can see that they’re trying to get better.”Having a 2025 campaign that was basically a year of stasis made little sense to me, and probably added to the discord amongst the St. Louis fanbase

====================

SPEAKER: John
---
Who is the best option for the Royals to trade for to shore up their outfield needs this offseason? Or do they go the free agent route?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Since the Royals have a need in both LF and 2B, Brendan Donovan might be the best fit since he can play either position (or toggle between the two)

====================

SPEAKER: Bosox Fan 1
---
Will the Red Sox show an  interest in J. T. Realmuto?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Narvez’s bat cooled off a lot as the season went on, but the Sox seem fine enough with him as their 1a catcher that any pursuit of Realmuto wouldn’t be a top priority

====================

SPEAKER: liptowi
---
Do you pull the plug on Volpe if he has a meh spring training and just go with Caballero or O. Cabrera until the trade deadline  (with Lombard in the wings for 2027)?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Caballero did enough in his short time in the Bronx that the Yankees might want to give him a real look as their shortstop (at least) until Volpe is healthy. Going out to get another veteran SS this winter is probably less likely due to Caballero’s presence.  And, due to the fact that the Yankees themselves haven’t given up on Volpe (even if it feels like 95% of Yankee fans have)

====================

SPEAKER: Sneaky
---
is the reason not many questions are about Cleveland because Cleveland is not going to do much beyond signing Hedges as C2 ? It sure seems when all the hype is pumping that they have several “extra” prospects that could fetch some help

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Guardians almost surely won’t be making any big signings, and it’s trickier to try and predict which trades they “might” make. There aren’t any obvious trade candidates on the roster (ala Naylor last year) going into this offseason, since chances are Kwan won’t be shopped until either the deadline or next offseason.

====================

SPEAKER: Rick
---
I’m thinking the Dodgers may go for Murakami for 3rd/1st base as Muncy & Freeman are getting close  to end of their contracts. What do you think? Thanks

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This would suggest the Dodgers would use Murakami as a LF for at least one season, since Muncy’s club option is very likely to be exercised. Can’t be ruled out, but it feels like the Dodgers probably wouldn’t be mentioned as a Murakami suitor if it wasn’t for their long history with landing Japanese talent

====================

SPEAKER: Chopper to Chipper
---
Bees?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Beads?! And with the catchphrase now achieved, we can call it a wrap on the chat.
