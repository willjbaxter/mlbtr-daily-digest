I would love to see them sign Tucker but find that unlikely. So, if not Tucker then who?  Thanks as always for the chats!</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I don&#x27;t see why Tucker wouldn&#x27;t be in play unless you&#x27;re assuming they re-sign Bellinger before Tucker comes off the board. I wouldn&#x27;t rule them out on any free agent hitters really First base might be tough because they&#x27;ve got Rice internally and can&#x27;t use the DH spot. Beyond that, any outfielder seems viable. They could make a run at Bichette and trade Jazz, or just roll with a Bo/Jazz middle infield tandem for a year and make Volpe play his way back into an everyday role</p>
<p><strong>Snelling:</strong> Snell said the Jays got lucky. Was he just making excuses for a unsuccessful performance?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I mean, it obviously wasn&#x27;t a great performance. He gave up homers on two of the first three pitches and issued four walks. It&#x27;s also true that he would&#x27;ve had 6 2/3 innings of three-run ball with seven strikeouts if Edgardo Henriquez had done his job behind him, which doesn&#x27;t look nearly as bad as five earned runs do</p>
<p><strong>Yes. Savage.:</strong> 12Ks. No walks. Still a rookie next year. How amazing was that outting? Also, does make Trey the default prediction for rookie of the year next year?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Of course it would not have mattered because this was happening on the other side of the ball I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d pick Yesavage to win ROY over Kevin McGonigle or something, but yeah, incredible performance. Insane that the dude was in A-ball a few months ago</p>
<p><strong>DJ Clutch:</strong> How would you resolve the weird roster jam the Astros are facing for position players?  Is it ridiculous to think Correa could handle 2nd if Paredes can&#x27;t?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I don&#x27;t see why Correa couldn&#x27;t play second base.  It&#x27;d still be a weird logjam because you need Paredes at third with Yordan/Altuve splitting LF without the fallback of moving Altuve back to second if he&#x27;s still bad in the outfield I think they just need to eat part of the Walker deal and move on</p>
<p><strong>Dipoto:</strong> I&#x27;m wondering how you see the 1st base market developing in free agency this offseason.  Will I be able to keep Naylor?  If I can&#x27;t, how will the two Japanese 1B/3B coming over impact the marketplace and what&#x27;s a reasonable cost estimate for Okamoto?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Yeah I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be so openly putting out there that they want to keep Naylor if they weren&#x27;t serious about making a competitive offer. Payroll&#x27;s going to be up a little bit from where they opened last season (as it should be) and they could hear teams out on Castillo again I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;d pay Murakami. I think we&#x27;re going to end up with Okamoto at four years in the $60M range. Tim seems open to the possibility that he pushes to five years, which I don&#x27;t see at his age. If Okamoto turns out to be a four-year deal guy, Seattle should probably just pay the few extra million annually to get Naylor done</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Gleyber Torres to Washington make any sense?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Eh, they need to do better than García but I don&#x27;t think Gleyber&#x27;s netting them much at the deadline and they&#x27;re still rebuilding If he takes something similar to this year&#x27;s 1/15, I&#x27;d rather just spend that money on a starter who has a better shot to be an in-demand trade chip. You&#x27;ll be able to pitch starters to almost every contender in July but there&#x27;ll only be a couple teams that want a second baseman without defensive flexibility And if Gleyber commands three-plus years, I wouldn&#x27;t be a fan of it for any team</p>
