I’ll get going in a few minutes, but opening the queue now to let people start asking questions. Let’s begin!</p>
<p><strong>Bernie Brewer:</strong> Luis Rengifo signed with the brewers the other day. How do you view this fit?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I think the fit is fine. I’d have liked to have seen a bigger swing via the trade market, but I have little doubt that the Brewers will find a way to get Rengifo back to decent-ish form. There aren’t many guys who’ve gone there recently and gotten worse, and they’ve helped plenty of players restore their stock in recent years.It’s a cheap deal, and Rengifo was a solid 1.5 to 2 WAR guy for a few years until this past season. They’re probably a win or so better, maybe two, with improved depth and without spending much.</p>
<p><strong>Jays Fan:</strong> Jays could use a righty bat. Mountcastle rumoured to be on the block. Rare inter-division trade perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Don’t know that I’d feel all that confident that he’d outperform Davis Schneider, who has more defensive utility. Plus, Mountcastle would cost Toronto more than $12MM after the luxury tax. I don’t think it’s a great fit.</p>
<p><strong>Mayo:</strong> Would you be willing to trade a prospect like Mayo for an injured prospect with more of a track record? Like Jones from the Pirates</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I’m a Jared Jones guy and not as bullish on Mayo as a lot of people in general, so I would absolutely give Mayo up to get Jones.I wouldn’t make that swap if I were the Pirates unless they have some reason to think the stuff won’t come all the way back or that Jones is just going to be constantly injured.</p>
<p><strong>Bounty:</strong> QO for Happ after 2026? Suzuki? Both? Neither? I can see an extension for Happ and the Cubs let Suzuki go for the QO</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Both are easy QO guys for me if their 2026 season looks like their past few years have</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Why woild the Dodgers risk losing both Ibánez and Rortvedt while keeping a player like Ward who they wouldnt even give a cup of coffee to last yr when they had injuries? Seems like they dont trust him.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> The Dodgers only ever wanted Ibanez/Rortvedt to try to pass them through waivers. Signing them both to one-year deals worth just over $1MM apiece was designed expressly to help each guy pass through waivers, knowing he wouldn’t reject an outright assignment upon clearing because doing so would mean forfeiting the guaranteed salary. Ward has options and is thus seen as flexible depth, which they don’t want to give up</p>
<p><strong>Cute Lady:</strong> But is Rengfio really that much better than Durbin?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> He might be worse, but that’s not the point. Milwaukee clearly wanted to get its hands on Harrison and/or Drohan (and probably feels Hamilton’s floor isn’t that far removed from what they expect from Durbin after some ’26 regression)</p>
<p><strong>Bob Casey:</strong> Does the UCL injury to Pablo Lopez get the Twins to make a move and sign pitcher?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I could see them signing Giolito or Littell, sure. Their payroll is in the gutter after all the trades.Smaller scale like Tyler Anderson, Jon Gray etc. probably also in play. Doubt it’d be someone like Scherzer, who’s clearly going to be prioritizing playing for a winner.</p>
<p><strong>White Sox:</strong> Could the CWS finish the season in 3rd place or better?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Sure. Need some things to break their way, but it’s a young team with lots of upside and the AL Central is a dumpster fire. Cleveland has done literally nothing to get better. Minnesota just lost its best or second-best SP after an offseason of minimal upgrades (and still has no bullpen). Kansas City is … fine? Outfield and 2B still look terrible, though. Lineup is extremely top-heavy, so one notable injury to Bobby Witt and they don’t even look like a surefire .500 club.</p>
<p><strong>Still an A:</strong> Aaron Civale got $6M, Sugano got $5.1, and Quintana got $6M. All got around the same amount. Which pitcher will do the best?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don’t like the landing spot for any of them, but Quintana is the best/most talented pitcher of the bunch for me A’s getting Civale for $6MM seems fine though. I assume you’re wondering if they’d have been better off giving that money to Sugano or Quintana.I’d take Civale over Sugano pretty easily, and while I’d prefer Q to Civale, we don’t know that Quintana would’ve been open to signing to play in a minor league stadium which has been a real turnoff for some free agents</p>
<p><strong>Six feet of bubble tape:</strong> Who replaces Tony Clark? Sean Casey? Gordon Bombay?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #999; font-style: italic;">... and 75 more exchanges</p></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><a href="../../index.html">← Back to All Posts</a><a href="#">Top ↑</a></div></div></body></html>
