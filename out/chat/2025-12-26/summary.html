Let’s open up the queue….</p>
<p><strong>Guest:</strong> What is goinf on withe Luis Roberts rumors</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’s hard to say if much or anything has changed about Robert’s market since the summer, except for the fact that his 2026 salary is now guaranteed.  My guess is that unless Chicago budges on its asking price, Robert will still be on the south side on Opening Day, as probably more teams view Robert as a Plan B rather than a top option</p>
<p><strong>Mike Elias:</strong> Any chance I’m still in on Kyle Tucker?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Probably not. If the O’s make another big strike, it would likely be for pitching.</p>
<p><strong>Friend:</strong> Do you see Arenado or Castellanos ending up with the Padres?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Arenado makes no sense given Machado’s presence at 3B.  Castellanos is a slightly better fit since SD isn’t entirely settled at DH, but if the Padres want an outfield bat, they can do a lot better. I guess Preller and Dombrowski might be able to come up with some kind of interesting bad contract swap, but I don’t really see a fit here</p>
<p><strong>Spider:</strong> What ther hold up realmuto</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’s worth noting that the last time JTR was a free agent, he didn’t sign until the end of January.  So he seems to be content in taking his time and monitoring the market, since one catching injury or another unexpected development could quickly bring another team into the fold.Philly has an offer on the table to Realmuto, so it seems like he’s evaluating things to see if any team is willing to match or top it.  Chances are Realmuto’s camp will then give the Phillies another chance to up their offer, and overall I expect Realmuto to re-sign</p>
<p><strong>The big Yo:</strong> Are the Vegas A’s going to win it all in ‘28 and is all star week going to be held in Vegas that same year?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> I’d expect MLB isn’t going to schedule the All-Star Game for Vegas until the stadium is fully up and running.  Seems like 2028 will be in an AL ballpark just because the 2025-27 games are all in NL parks, and Toronto is apparently lobbying hard to host another ASG soon</p>
<p><strong>Dipoto:</strong> How available are the elite 2B targets like Marte and Jazz?  Is it just smoke?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Seems like Marte is more available, albeit at a much higher price tag.  I’m not sure Chisholm is really “available” outside of the broad way in which teams are usually open to hearing offers about impending free agents.</p>
<p><strong>Stevil:</strong> It seems likely to me that acquiring Ketel Marte might mean taking Gurriel with him. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Gurriel is owed $13MM in 2026, and there’s a $5MM buyout of his $14MM club option for 2027.Maybe the argument can be made that Marte is enough of a relative bargain that adding another $18MM to the tally still works out in another team’s favor, and maybe the math works if that other team isn’t terribly deep in prospects.  And, if the D’Backs really are doing something like trying to move Marte in order to sign Bregman, maybe they’d just like to clear as much payroll as possible.But, overall, teams don’t want to water down the value of a price trade asset (like Marte) by attaching an undesirable contract to the package.  Gurriel’s salary isn’t so onerous that Arizona can’t just eat it for one year left.</p>
<p><strong>CardfaninIL:</strong> What is the best return we can get for JoJo? And can put a top15 kid with Nolan to get a better return? Thx</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Likewise, a rebuilding team like the Cardinals isn’t likely to move any kind of notable prospect along with Arenado just to help a trade go through.  The Cards have shown they’ll just eat some salary to accommodate these deals in order to help improve the returns.</p>
<p><strong>grunt:</strong> what would it cost to get santander from bluejays  for the reds</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Hard to see a trade match there.  If you’re the Reds and you’re in need of offensive help, surely you’d want someone who a) isn’t so expensive, and b) isn’t coming off essentially a non-starter of a 2025 season.</p>
<p><strong>GOATcloserEstabanYan:</strong> How likely is it that Rays trade Yandy, Rasmussen, etc. and just go all in on a full blown rebuild?</p>
