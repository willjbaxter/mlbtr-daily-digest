<p><strong>World Series Prediction:</strong> Who you got?  Blue Jays win 4-3 or Dodgers steal the show?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Who wins Game 7?Blue Jays(65.3% | 548 votes)Dodgers(34.6% | 290 votes)Total Votes: 838</p>
<p><strong>AA:</strong> Do I sign cease or king this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Leaning towards no, since the Braves under Anthopoulos haven’t pursued longer-term pitching contracts.  Cease is also a Boras client, and AA generally doesn’t do business with Boras on a free agent level.King is an interesting option for a somewhat shorter-term contract with opt-outs involved.  It depends on how his market shapes up since there’s still a very good chance he lands a big multi-year deal anyway, but if he doesn’t want to fully commit himself after a shortened 2025 season, he and his reps might be open to more creative contracts.  This might open the door to a team like Atlanta to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Hang over:</strong> So will the first day of free agency be crazy after the World Series is completed?  Which teams do you see making the most waves?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Free agency doesn’t begin until five days after the final game of the WS.  The offseason in general starts immediately, however, so I’d expect a lot of news on options being exercised/declined, maybe a couple of trades, maybe the Padres/Rockies/Braves announce their new manager or GM, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Dean:</strong> Who’s the splashiest surprise (ala Eflin, HSK) FA signing you could see the Rays making?  Realmuto?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’s hard to see the Rays outbidding Philly for Realmuto.  I can also assume that Realmuto probably feels the Phillies are closer to winning in 2026 than the Rays are, so that’s not likely to be an option for him.Projecting free agent moves for Tampa is difficult since when they do strike, it tends to be somewhat out of nowhere.  Nobody saw them as suitors for Kim, for instance.  Bringing in an Eflin type of innings-eater might be a good move this winter due to the injury uncertainties in their rotation.</p>
<p><strong>BrianM:</strong> Does Pete resign with the Mets?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Leaning towards no.  I think it took a particular set of circumstances to reunite Alonso and the Mets last winter, and it feels like the Mets only have a certain price point for Alonso in mind.  Coming off a much better platform season, Alonso likely isn’t in the mood to take any kind of shorter-term pact this time around.</p>
<p><strong>Nido:</strong> Could Nido have earned a one year MLB contract rather than sign with the Tigers for triple A?  Seems like a good player</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Nido is a career backup at best.  He clearly seems ok with his situation in Detroit even if it’s being the third man on the depth chart.  Taking an early contract now and giving himself peace of mind over the offseason might also be preferable to having to grind out months of waiting and seeing before finally landing another minors deal months later</p>
<p><strong>IMissHelton:</strong> Do the Rockies keep dragging their feet through the offseason? Most other teams have hired their GM/manager tandem for the future while the Rox are still “mulling their options”</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Remember, this is seemingly the first time Dick Monfort has ever had a real GM search, after just promoting from within for the other two hires of his ownership tenure.  Makes sense that it might take a bit longer than usual, though given how much the new GM will have to do with overhauling the Rockies, every offseason day is critical.</p>
<p><strong>Wisconsin O’s:</strong> Any chance the O’s sign a big rh bat &gt; Bo B? Please please say yes.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Bichette isn’t a fit on a team already loaded in the infield, and I don’t expect the Orioles to spend at the highest ends of the free agent market.  But, they should be adding some kind of righty balance to the lineup.</p>
<p><strong>Mike B:</strong> Since the trade deadline, I have had this idea of the Phillies trading Nick Castellanos (plus a mid-level prospect) to the Pirates for Bryan Reynolds (the advanced metrics seem to suggest Reynolds down season was just some bad luck, as he was still in line with his career numbers for Barrel Rate, XBA, XSLG, and XWOBA – among others). Essentially, I am banking on Pittsburgh wanting to be as cheap as possible (not a bad bet with that ownership group) and saving them $50ish million in the long term. Can you please just tell me I’m crazy so I can stop considering this as a possibility?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> While I don’t doubt that the Pirates might deal Reynolds under the right circumstance, this particular move doesn’t make any sense for them.  Pittsburgh should be trying to add hitting, not take on a limited player like Castellanos who seems to be on the downswing.</p>
