Good afternoon! Hope everyone enjoyed the weekend. I'll get going at 3pm CT, but as always, feel free to send in some questions ahead of time. Hey all! Sorry for the delay Lot of news happening right now as well.

If Sonny Gray agreed to waive his NTC, what could the Cardinals expect to get in return?  How underwater is his contract?  Thanks!

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams

I don't really think there's any surplus value there. You can say there's no such thing as a bad one-year deal, but Gray is being paid $35MM next year and has a $5MM buyout on a 2027 option. Is he getting $40MM if he goes to the open market and says he'll only sign a one-year deal? I doubt that. Even if you think it's not that much of an overpay, there's no excess value. I think they'd probably have to cover part of the salary to get anything of real note.

OK, Steve, you're the Astros.  Next year, do you put Issac Parades at 2nd and move Altuve to Left Field?  Move Parades to left field?  Move Parades to DH and play Yordan to left...or just trade Parades?  What would you do?
