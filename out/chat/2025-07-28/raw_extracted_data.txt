Good afternoon! Three days until the deadline. Deals have started up, but the real avalanche is coming. Let's talk about it all! We'll get going at 3pm CT, but feel free to submit questions in advance, as usual. Good afternoon!

====================

SPEAKER: Rox
---
Would a Jarren Duran for Mitch Keller 1-for-1 swap work? Or would the Pirates want younger players for the future?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
If the Pirates are trading Keller, I'd expect it to be for multiple young big leaguers with 6+ years of club control who are years from making any real money.

====================

SPEAKER: Matt
---
Which available player do you believe Dave Dombrowski would look at and say yes trading a Crawford, Miller or Abel would be worth the investment?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Jhoan Duran or Cade Smith

====================

SPEAKER: Ryan H
---
With Clase out now, is Ryan Helsley now the best reliever likely to be traded?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don't think Clase was ever "likely" to be traded. Helsley is likely to go, but David Bednar is just as likely and I think Bednar is better (and he has a lower 2025 salary with an extra year of club control)

====================

SPEAKER: Stavid Dearns
---
Going for it here: Luisangel Acuna, Brett Baty, Brandon Sproat, Blade Tidwell, Jesus Baez, Boston Baro for Mitch Keller, David Bednar, and Oneil Cruz-Who says no?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
With the exception of Baty, that sees like a collection of players whose value is down this season. If you somehow want all of Keller/Bednar/(especially) Cruz, you're going to have to give up WAY more than that. That's a non-starter.

====================

SPEAKER: Ken
---
Severino, Urias, and $20M to the Cubs for Jaxon Wiggins. Who says no?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Severino/Urias isn't enough of an upgrade to part with Wiggins

====================

SPEAKER: Cat_Herder
---
Paddock trade a depth move or does Fetter spin straw to gold?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Curious to see if the Tigers put him in the 'pen, which I think the Twins should've done even though Paddack prefers to start. He looked filthy in relief coming back from Tommy John late in 2023, and he's never been able to hold up as a starter.

====================

SPEAKER: Sam
---
Hey Steve - Are the Twins in fire sale mode now? Are we going back to the early 2010s of just having a completely depleted roster?

====================
