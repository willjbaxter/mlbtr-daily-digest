Good morning, and happy holidays to all! I'll get going a bit earlier than usual today, 11am CT. Feel free to start sending in questions ahead of time, as always. Good morning! Let's get underway

====================

SPEAKER: Guarded Indian

Is Fairchild Cleveland's answer for the RH hitting OF help or do they actually spend on someone else?  If Clase and Ortiz come off the payroll could they afford Bader?  I don't want Hays (injured) or Andujar (not great one defense).

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
He's just a minor league depth add -- not any kind of answer. Fairchild is only a slightly above-average hitter in his career versus LHP.Hays, Andujar, Randal Grichuk and Rob Refsnyder are all out there as RHH outfielders to join the outfield mix there. I think any of the bunch make sense as a reasonable addition. None will cost too much

====================

SPEAKER: Ross the Boss

What could I get back for Berrios if I toss in $36mil in cash in a trade?  He had a down year, but a innings eating #4/5 at $10mil/season is still a very valuable commodity.  Ponce is now my #5, it would be essentially no more money for ownership, and I could recoup something of value for Jose.

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
It might be reasonable to think Berrios is worth $10MM annually, but I doubt he'd get that over three years in free agency this winter. Most teams would be looking at him for one or two years. I don't think paying him down to 3/30 is enough to get anything of value.Three of four seasons with a sub-20 K%. Walk rate jumped to 8% this past year (still solid but much higher than his 6.3% over the four preceding seasons). Career-low four-seam and sinker velos. Tons of home runs. Poor finish from July onward.I think you're overvaluing Berrios.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony

which under the radar FA Pitcher is the best buy low high rewards candidate?  1year / $5 - 10million.
