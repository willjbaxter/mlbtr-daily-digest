Good afternoon, hope you've all had a good holiday season! Lots in the queue today, let's get rolling

====================

SPEAKER: Natitude Dude
---
Is M Gore getting dealt this off-season? If so, what kind of return can be expected after the Baz deal?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I still think he'll get moved this offseason. Would expect a better headliner than Tampa Bay got in the Baz trade and a slightly stronger package overall. Think Gore's more valuable despite Baz have the extra year of arbitration control

====================

SPEAKER: KerryFam4
---
We’ve now had two Japanese players sign short term deals with opt-outs at lower than expected rates.  Do you think that will impact the remaining unsigned Japanese player(s)?  Should we read anything from that into the markets for Tucker, Bichette, Bregman, Valdez, etc?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Not reading a whole lot into it. Seems more that MLB teams didn't think Murakami or Imai are particularly good If all the top free agents are still unsigned two or three weeks from now, I'd come more around to the idea that of shorter-term contracts with outs for them

====================

SPEAKER: gavin
---
should the padres trade pivetta to the cubs/mets/yankees for prospects and sign basset or giolito?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I think it's too cute. Pivetta's just much better than those guys and the rotation is pretty weak beyond the top three. I understand the concern about potentially losing Pivetta and King next offseason, but the Padres are almost always operating in some kind of chaos like that because they overpaid Bogaerts, Darvish and Cronenworth

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
In your opinion, which outlet is the best for prospect coverage? Is there one you guys typically use?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Baseball America's the gold standard for me, but there's obviously a lot of good work out there and value in getting different outlets' opinions on players. We'll reference BA, FanGraphs, Kiley McDaniel's work at ESPN, Keith Law at The Athletic and MLB Pipeline

====================

SPEAKER: Arise, Sir Loin of Beef
---
Are there any upper tier OFs available in a trade this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
It's not great, especially if Boston holds everybody. Donovan could kind of fit that description even though he's more impactful at second base and/or bouncing around the infield. We've seen that kind of ceiling from Robert and Nootbaar before but not recently I think it's more likely to come available at the deadline. Red Sox are pretty well positioned on the pitching staff now but injuries could change that by the summer. If Cleveland struggles, Kwan should go in July. Maybe Minnesota reevaluates on Buxton and their top starters at that point if their half-in hope of competing this year blows up

====================

SPEAKER: A's or Marlins?
---
Between the A's and Marlins, which team do you believe is in a stronger position to compete for a wild card spot this season?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I'd take Miami's roster right now but that probably flips if the A's add a mid-rotation caliber starter. Still think they're both long shots but more realistic dark horses than they've been entering any of the past couple seasons

====================

SPEAKER: Confused
---
Why is Brendan Donovan so highly-sought after? Minimal power and he doesn’t have the .300 batting average to offset that?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Almost no one hits .300 anymore. There were seven qualified hitters who have done that in each of the past two seasons. Donovan's a reliable bet to hit .280 with an OBP above .350. Not huge power but enough for double-digit homers and 30 doubles It's really tough to find players who do that while playing up the middle. The league average second baseman last year hit .243/.310/.371

====================

SPEAKER: Chris
---
Who is one player you think could possibly be traded this offseason who has not been speculated in trade discussions?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Still think the Giants should trade Robbie Ray to clear $25M next year for a move at second base or in right field

====================

SPEAKER: Giacomo Puccini
---
Who’s the best active player not to win an MVP?

====================
