<p><strong>Ewitkows:</strong> Do the Brewers just stand pat?Â Â Ortiz has been better and Durbin has been a spark plug at 3B.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> I think the Brewers should offer a package of some of their top prospects for Oneil Cruz because they could get the most out of him. Is that reasonable?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel H:</strong> Do the Brewers pull the trigger on a 3B/1B power bat, or should I just keep dreaming and have my heart broken again at the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I lean towards Milwaukee being pretty quiet. Can&#x27;t see Pittsburgh trading Cruz in division, and I&#x27;d be pretty surprised if they did that at all given how badly they need offense Durbin has solidified third, doubt they&#x27;re finding a better shortstop than Ortiz on this market. They make sense for O&#x27;Hearn or Josh Bell, I guess, but they&#x27;ll get Rhys back at some point as well Get a better utility infielder than MOnasterio, maybe a rotational outfield bat depending on Frelick&#x27;s timetable. I don&#x27;t know that they need to go crazy beyond that. They&#x27;re already really good and pretty deep everywhere</p>
<p><strong>Hels Bells:</strong> What do the Cardinals get for Ryan Helsley? Could they pry Bobby Miller from the Dodgers? And who will be the top suitors for him?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I think they&#x27;d do better than Miller on Helsley, though I get the appeal of trying to take a flier on Miller since the velocity is still elite. Helsley&#x27;s still the top rental reliever for me, though his value is down from when they should&#x27;ve moved him over the winter</p>
<p><strong>Ken:</strong> On August 1, Jeffrey Springs is playing for whom?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I&#x27;ll take the Giants</p>
<p><strong>Duran:</strong> At first glance, the Red Sox rejection of the Cease/Salas/prospect trade offer for Duran seems like lunacy. A high-strikeout ace and a blue chip prospect for a guy having a down year that they&#x27;re running out of space for? But looking at Salas, heâs slashed just .221/.305/.347 over his three years in the minors. Why do prospect outlets rank him so highly? And is the league as a whole just more pessimistic on him than the major prospect outlets?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> He was a huge amateur talent and you can kind of write off the poor offensive numbers with how aggressively the Padres moved him. Most 18-year-old catchers are in high school or rookie ball and San Diego had him in High-A (probably too aggressively) The back injury is a real concern though. I agree that if the Red Sox actually thought Salas was one of the top 30 prospects in MLB, they&#x27;d be willing to give up Duran for him and Cease</p>
<p><strong>Yanks:</strong> Whatâs your view on the McMahon trade? With Suarez on the block, this feels like a major disappointment</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I&#x27;m not a huge RyMac fan in general at this point, but only one team can get SuÃ¡rez and the prospect cost would&#x27;ve been higher than it was on McMahon Argument that he fits the ballpark a little better than SuÃ¡rez does as a lefty bat. I wouldn&#x27;t be super enthused about taking his entire contract, but he&#x27;s better than Peraza/Vivas and he&#x27;s a more sensible SuÃ¡rez fallback for them than Ke&#x27;Bryan Hayes would have been</p>
<p><strong>Taj Boyale?:</strong> Does Joe Boyle get the rotation slot vacated by Taj?Â Â If so, will he be on any innings limit or do you think he&#x27;ll hold that slot for the remainder of the season? Thanks</p>
