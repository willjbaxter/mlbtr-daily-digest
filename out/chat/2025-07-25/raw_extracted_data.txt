Hey everyone, hope you've enjoyed your week! Crunched on time today for obvious reasons so I need to keep this right at an hour. Apologies in advance if I don't get to your question. Let's get rolling

====================

SPEAKER: Ewitkows
---
Do the Brewers just stand pat?Â Â Ortiz has been better and Durbin has been a spark plug at 3B.

====================

SPEAKER: Bob
---
I think the Brewers should offer a package of some of their top prospects for Oneil Cruz because they could get the most out of him. Is that reasonable?

====================

SPEAKER: Daniel H
---
Do the Brewers pull the trigger on a 3B/1B power bat, or should I just keep dreaming and have my heart broken again at the deadline.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I lean towards Milwaukee being pretty quiet. Can't see Pittsburgh trading Cruz in division, and I'd be pretty surprised if they did that at all given how badly they need offense Durbin has solidified third, doubt they're finding a better shortstop than Ortiz on this market. They make sense for O'Hearn or Josh Bell, I guess, but they'll get Rhys back at some point as well Get a better utility infielder than MOnasterio, maybe a rotational outfield bat depending on Frelick's timetable. I don't know that they need to go crazy beyond that. They're already really good and pretty deep everywhere

====================

SPEAKER: Hels Bells
---
What do the Cardinals get for Ryan Helsley? Could they pry Bobby Miller from the Dodgers? And who will be the top suitors for him?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I think they'd do better than Miller on Helsley, though I get the appeal of trying to take a flier on Miller since the velocity is still elite. Helsley's still the top rental reliever for me, though his value is down from when they should've moved him over the winter

====================

SPEAKER: Ken
---
On August 1, Jeffrey Springs is playing for whom?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I'll take the Giants

====================

SPEAKER: Duran
---
At first glance, the Red Sox rejection of the Cease/Salas/prospect trade offer for Duran seems like lunacy. A high-strikeout ace and a blue chip prospect for a guy having a down year that they're running out of space for? But looking at Salas, heâs slashed just .221/.305/.347 over his three years in the minors. Why do prospect outlets rank him so highly? And is the league as a whole just more pessimistic on him than the major prospect outlets?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
He was a huge amateur talent and you can kind of write off the poor offensive numbers with how aggressively the Padres moved him. Most 18-year-old catchers are in high school or rookie ball and San Diego had him in High-A (probably too aggressively) The back injury is a real concern though. I agree that if the Red Sox actually thought Salas was one of the top 30 prospects in MLB, they'd be willing to give up Duran for him and Cease

====================

SPEAKER: Yanks
---
Whatâs your view on the McMahon trade? With Suarez on the block, this feels like a major disappointment

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I'm not a huge RyMac fan in general at this point, but only one team can get SuÃ¡rez and the prospect cost would've been higher than it was on McMahon Argument that he fits the ballpark a little better than SuÃ¡rez does as a lefty bat. I wouldn't be super enthused about taking his entire contract, but he's better than Peraza/Vivas and he's a more sensible SuÃ¡rez fallback for them than Ke'Bryan Hayes would have been

====================

SPEAKER: Taj Boyale?
---
Does Joe Boyle get the rotation slot vacated by Taj?Â Â If so, will he be on any innings limit or do you think he'll hold that slot for the remainder of the season? Thanks

====================
