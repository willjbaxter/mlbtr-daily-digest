<p><strong>Dirt:</strong> Michael Harris has gotten on track but Ozzie still isn&#x27;t doing much with the bat. With Nacho Alvarez getting seasoned, do you think the Braves will pick up the option on Albies, then trade him or just let him walk? What will AA do about the starting rotation?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don&#x27;t see any scenario where the Braves just buy him out and let him walk to save what would be a net $4MM. Even if they&#x27;re just done with him, a team would absolutely trade for Albies at a year and $7MM -- especially with a subsequent option for the same amount.Terrible year (well, yearS, plural) or not, Albies is a 28-year-old former All-Star 2B with multiple 30-homer seasons under his belt.Conversely, open up our Contract Tracker -- included with your subscription! -- to check out what kind of position players a year and $7MM can buy you in free agency: https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/contracttracker?name=&amp;team=0&amp;position=H... You&#x27;re looking at bounceback shots in the dark for mid-30s veterans like AJ Pollock, Tommy Pham, Carlos Santana, Robinson Chirinos, etc. It&#x27;s just not a compelling group, and it&#x27;s only exacerbated in recent years as the general cost of signing free agents has increased.Add in the value the second $7MM option brings if Albies rebounds next year, and he&#x27;d still have legitimate trade value, even coming off a down year. That&#x27;s not to say they&#x27;d get a top-100 prospect or any kind of real farm-altering prospect, but they could get something with some actual value and not just completely need to dump the money he&#x27;s owed.</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to The Show 1st?:</strong> Who gets to The Show first? Bubba Chandler or Jonah Tong? When and why?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Chandler. He&#x27;s been in Triple-A for a full year now. Tong hasn&#x27;t thrown a pitch in AAA (he&#x27;s being promoted there today).I&#x27;d imagine that after August 15, once there are few enough remaining days on the calendar that prospects who are called up can retain their rookie status heading into 2026, Chandler&#x27;s developmental issues will magically be sorted out and he&#x27;ll be in the majors Chandler.
