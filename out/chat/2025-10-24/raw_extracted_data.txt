Good afternoon, hope you're all well! Looking forward to another of these Busy week for us with offseason prep so I'm going to keep this one at an hour. Let's get going

====================

SPEAKER: Bo nose
---
I sure hope Bichette's addition to the Jays' roster is not a sentimental move nor one anticipating contributions defensively. Ordinarily a plus bat, the area where, arguably, the Blue Jays are strongest as a team right now, he has been feeble against L.A. over the past two years. That's only six games but, combined with the lay-off, is his best usage more likely to be as a super-sub PH than in any starting defender capacity? I think the noise about using him at 2nd is just that, noise.

====================

SPEAKER: Duffy Scliff
---
Does Toronto realistically have a shot in this series? Does the fact that LAD hasnâ€™t played in awhile hurt them?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Dodgers are favorites but it's like 55-45, they've definitely got a shot. L.A.'s bullpen still feels like a weakness and the Jays should put up a much better fight against the rotation than Milwaukee did We'll see on Bo. Obviously if he can move at all, then playing him at second would be ideal. Use Clement at third with Barger in RF and IKF as a defensive sub late in games. If he's so hobbled that he can't field a ground-ball, well he's at least a better pinch-hitting option than Loperfido would've been

====================

SPEAKER: Hopeful Halo
---
What do you think the angels chances are to land a top starter like Valdez?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Would be out of character for Moreno and they've got so many other needs that I don't think using most of the budget on one top starter would be the wisest choice anyway I could see them more in on Gallen or a boring innings eater like Littell. They'll need to spend something on a center fielder and a third baseman and should at least bring Kenley back to solidify the back of the bullpen

====================

SPEAKER: Japanese Players
---
Who do you think gets the highest contract for Japanese pitchers coming over this year? Imai seems to be the one getting most of the conversation now. I do wonder if he might be getting a little to hyped now? It does seem sometimes we get hyped for a player and they struggle coming over.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Yeah it'll be Imai. He's a bit of split camp guy but I'd be surprised if he signs for less than $130M I think the recent track record for the top NPB starters is pretty good actually. Yamamoto's phenomenal. Tanaka worked out really well, Imanaga was excellent value at 4/53. Jury's still out on Sasaki but for even if he's only a late-inning reliever, that's well worth what the Dodgers paid with the hard capped bonuses

====================

SPEAKER: Rangers13
---
How much do you expect Okamoto to cost?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
We all landed at three years and between $33-45MM but there's a really wide error bar on the predictions for players (especially hitters) coming over from foreign leagues Seems like he's at least equally interesting as Jeimer Candelario or Jurickson Profar were though

====================

SPEAKER: Ding a ling
---
HasDillon Dinglerreally changed his hit tool? Both FanGraphs and MLB gave him a 30 as a prospect, but this past season, he hit for a respectable average. Who's the real Dillon Dingler?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Yeah definitely think he's better than a 30 hit tool. Big step forward in his in-zone contact rate, fewer chases. Hits the ball hard enough to post decent results on balls in play, even if he's probably not turning in a .345 BABIP every year Feels like a 50 hitter with average pop who plays really strong defense behind the plate. Good player

====================

SPEAKER: Mike Yastrzemski
---
Please find me a home?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I fully expect the Royals to bring him back on a one-year deal for $10-12M. He hit well there and it's obviously an ongoing need If they go elsewhere, Philly, Pittsburgh or Cleveland would work. Wouldn't pick the Giants to do it after they traded him but it's not like Luis Matos/Drew Gilbert seized the RF job. If they focus most of their resources on the rotation and Yaz is out for $8M in February, I don't see why they wouldn't be willing to circle back

====================

SPEAKER: Arthur Dent
---
Any chance the Guardians will entertain offers in Steven Kwan? If so, what would Cleveland be looking for in return?

====================
