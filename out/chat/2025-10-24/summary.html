Looking forward to another of these Busy week for us with offseason prep so I&#x27;m going to keep this one at an hour. Let&#x27;s get going</p>
<p><strong>Bo nose:</strong> I sure hope Bichette&#x27;s addition to the Jays&#x27; roster is not a sentimental move nor one anticipating contributions defensively. Ordinarily a plus bat, the area where, arguably, the Blue Jays are strongest as a team right now, he has been feeble against L.A. over the past two years. That&#x27;s only six games but, combined with the lay-off, is his best usage more likely to be as a super-sub PH than in any starting defender capacity? I think the noise about using him at 2nd is just that, noise.</p>
<p><strong>Duffy Scliff:</strong> Does Toronto realistically have a shot in this series? Does the fact that LAD hasn’t played in awhile hurt them?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Dodgers are favorites but it&#x27;s like 55-45, they&#x27;ve definitely got a shot. L.A.&#x27;s bullpen still feels like a weakness and the Jays should put up a much better fight against the rotation than Milwaukee did We&#x27;ll see on Bo. Obviously if he can move at all, then playing him at second would be ideal. Use Clement at third with Barger in RF and IKF as a defensive sub late in games. If he&#x27;s so hobbled that he can&#x27;t field a ground-ball, well he&#x27;s at least a better pinch-hitting option than Loperfido would&#x27;ve been</p>
<p><strong>Hopeful Halo:</strong> What do you think the angels chances are to land a top starter like Valdez?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Would be out of character for Moreno and they&#x27;ve got so many other needs that I don&#x27;t think using most of the budget on one top starter would be the wisest choice anyway I could see them more in on Gallen or a boring innings eater like Littell. They&#x27;ll need to spend something on a center fielder and a third baseman and should at least bring Kenley back to solidify the back of the bullpen</p>
<p><strong>Japanese Players:</strong> Who do you think gets the highest contract for Japanese pitchers coming over this year? Imai seems to be the one getting most of the conversation now. I do wonder if he might be getting a little to hyped now? It does seem sometimes we get hyped for a player and they struggle coming over.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Yeah it&#x27;ll be Imai. He&#x27;s a bit of split camp guy but I&#x27;d be surprised if he signs for less than $130M I think the recent track record for the top NPB starters is pretty good actually. Yamamoto&#x27;s phenomenal. Tanaka worked out really well, Imanaga was excellent value at 4/53. Jury&#x27;s still out on Sasaki but for even if he&#x27;s only a late-inning reliever, that&#x27;s well worth what the Dodgers paid with the hard capped bonuses</p>
<p><strong>Rangers13:</strong> How much do you expect Okamoto to cost?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> We all landed at three years and between $33-45MM but there&#x27;s a really wide error bar on the predictions for players (especially hitters) coming over from foreign leagues Seems like he&#x27;s at least equally interesting as Jeimer Candelario or Jurickson Profar were though</p>
<p><strong>Ding a ling:</strong> HasDillon Dinglerreally changed his hit tool? Both FanGraphs and MLB gave him a 30 as a prospect, but this past season, he hit for a respectable average. Who&#x27;s the real Dillon Dingler?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Yeah definitely think he&#x27;s better than a 30 hit tool. Big step forward in his in-zone contact rate, fewer chases. Hits the ball hard enough to post decent results on balls in play, even if he&#x27;s probably not turning in a .345 BABIP every year Feels like a 50 hitter with average pop who plays really strong defense behind the plate. Good player</p>
<p><strong>Mike Yastrzemski:</strong> Please find me a home?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> I fully expect the Royals to bring him back on a one-year deal for $10-12M. He hit well there and it&#x27;s obviously an ongoing need If they go elsewhere, Philly, Pittsburgh or Cleveland would work. Wouldn&#x27;t pick the Giants to do it after they traded him but it&#x27;s not like Luis Matos/Drew Gilbert seized the RF job. If they focus most of their resources on the rotation and Yaz is out for $8M in February, I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to circle back</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Dent:</strong> Any chance the Guardians will entertain offers in Steven Kwan? If so, what would Cleveland be looking for in return?</p>
