Good afternoon! Sorry to not get the queue up for advance questions a bit sooner. I'll get going at 3pm, but feel free to ask a question ahead of time if you prefer. Greetings! Let's get underway

====================

SPEAKER: Dodger Fan 1750
---
Do you see a big trade splash happening soon with the Dodgers? Do you think Mason or Clause is possible for CP? If not pitching, what other trade do you see happening?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Everything deadline-wise, for every team, has to happen "soon" -- we're ten days out!But yeah, I think the Dodgers are going to add a reliever of note. I don't think Miller moves. Clase, I can see, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. If the Dodgers come away with Bednar or Helsley, that's still a notable upgrade. And I think both guys end up changing hands.

====================

SPEAKER: Coach
---
Sandy Leon called up to ATL. Smoke = trade fire?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Leon just kind of reinforces the idea that Ozuna's not going to play a ton. His promotion in and of itself isn't a meaningful development so much as just one more piece of evidence to support what already felt inevitable: Ozuna will be traded.

====================

SPEAKER: Crusty Old Os Fan
---
If a player has an option, and exercises it, is his current team allowed to submit a QO in order to recoup a draft pick?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I assume this is supposed to say "opt-out" and not "option"? Yes, a team can make a qualifying offer to a player if he triggers an opt-out in his contract and becomes a free agent Well -- as long as he hasn't received a QO in the past and spent the entire season on that club's major league roster/injured list.

====================

SPEAKER: Unqualified Reds Armchair GM
---
Reds started Marte in right field yesterday. He seemed to handle it fine. Do they go bring back Eugenio to man 3b?

====================
