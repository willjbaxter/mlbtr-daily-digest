<p><strong>Dodger Fan 1750:</strong> Do you see a big trade splash happening soon with the Dodgers? Do you think Mason or Clause is possible for CP? If not pitching, what other trade do you see happening?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Everything deadline-wise, for every team, has to happen &quot;soon&quot; -- we&#x27;re ten days out!But yeah, I think the Dodgers are going to add a reliever of note. I don&#x27;t think Miller moves. Clase, I can see, but I wouldn&#x27;t get my hopes up. If the Dodgers come away with Bednar or Helsley, that&#x27;s still a notable upgrade. And I think both guys end up changing hands.</p>
<p><strong>Coach:</strong> Sandy Leon called up to ATL. Smoke = trade fire?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Leon just kind of reinforces the idea that Ozuna&#x27;s not going to play a ton. His promotion in and of itself isn&#x27;t a meaningful development so much as just one more piece of evidence to support what already felt inevitable: Ozuna will be traded.</p>
<p><strong>Crusty Old Os Fan:</strong> If a player has an option, and exercises it, is his current team allowed to submit a QO in order to recoup a draft pick?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I assume this is supposed to say &quot;opt-out&quot; and not &quot;option&quot;? Yes, a team can make a qualifying offer to a player if he triggers an opt-out in his contract and becomes a free agent Well -- as long as he hasn&#x27;t received a QO in the past and spent the entire season on that club&#x27;s major league roster/injured list.</p>
<p><strong>Unqualified Reds Armchair GM:</strong> Reds started Marte in right field yesterday. He seemed to handle it fine. Do they go bring back Eugenio to man 3b?</p>
