There&#x27;s a lot already queued up so apologies in advance for anything I can&#x27;t cover. Let&#x27;s get rolling</p>
<p><strong>Black and Gold Bleeder:</strong> Do the Pirates have a reasonable shot at either Suarez or Okamoto?? They need power from the third base position before anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Yeah it seems like either of those should be viable with their current spending posture, especially if Geno ends up at two years. Not sure how a low-OBP righty bat would play at PNC but agree that third base is a need and they should be after offense wherever they can get it</p>
<p><strong>Giants fan:</strong> As a giants fan im confused on the direction they should go. Signing a pitchers to longterm contracts doesn&#x27;t seem to be the giants course. The giants have money to spend a knowledgeable fan base too. 10 outfielders on the roster not enough infield depth. The giants as mentioned in your trade rumors comments today lists a solid core of young pitchers but lacking experience. Trades are possible. Please give your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Well I think they should sign Kyle Tucker but that&#x27;s an ownership question more than a front office one. If they&#x27;re limited to the Gallen/King tier in free agency (I&#x27;d prefer the latter for any team), then they&#x27;re probably leveraging some of those upper level starters for an outfielder Nootbaar&#x27;s available and Cardinals are targeting high level starters. I wouldn&#x27;t give up Roupp for Noot but if STL likes Whisenhunt or McDonald, maybe that gets the ball rolling Similar logic with Ketel (Roupp/Birdsong should be on the table there), but I have a tough time seeing Arizona moving him at all -- much less in division</p>
<p><strong>Mariners:</strong> What/who do you think makes the first major move at the meetings? What team/free agent? Is it a trade or a signing?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Based on my annual last place finishes in the Top 50 contest, I recommend ignoring any of my predictions But give me Framber to Baltimore</p>
<p><strong>David:</strong> Stearns says he wants to prioritize defense this off-season which he proved with the Semien trade.  However there is  always talk of moving Vientos to first which would probably be a drop from Alonso since he’s never played there.  What do you think the Mets will do at 1B if they don’t resign Pete to bolster the defense</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Disagree a little with the premise, not like Pete&#x27;s an elite defender there either. I think having Vientos log any meaningful time at 3B would cut against the infield defense priority, so the question is whether they think he&#x27;ll bounce back enough at the plate to warrant 1B/DH time or whether it&#x27;s time to move on entirely If the goal is solely to upgrade the defense, they&#x27;d probably be best off signing Bregman and moving Baty to first. I think that&#x27;s too far in the other direction and still expect them to get something done with Alonso personally</p>
<p><strong>Gonzo for Gonzo:</strong> Thoughts on the Pirates-Red Sox deal? Losing the best nickname in baseball and a RH OF plus having to dump Criswell seems like a steep price for the Sox, they must believe they can unlock something with Oviedo. Makes lots of sense for Pirates if the Password can hit at the MLB level.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> Yeah I like it more for Pittsburgh but I&#x27;m not super enamored with either player, so I get the logic on both sides Oviedo&#x27;s probably the seventh-best starter that Pittsburgh had. They ran out Tommy Pham and Alexander Canario in LF for most of last season. I&#x27;m concerned about Garcia&#x27;s approach and still think they should be in the outfield market, but he has minor league options and enough promise (power, youth, upper minors track record) that he&#x27;s a guy they should absolutely be willing to roll the dice on Wasn&#x27;t going to have the opportunity for everyday reps that he&#x27;d need to develop the approach, so I&#x27;m fine with Boston moving on. Would&#x27;ve expected them to do better than Oviedo, but Tim Dierkes&#x27;s immediate response was &quot;not sure why Garcia is considered a Top 100 prospect, but I&#x27;ll leave that to the experts&quot; and I tend to agree I don&#x27;t think Oviedo&#x27;s more than a five-and-dive starter unless the Sox can teach him a splitter or something, but he&#x27;d be more interesting to me out of the bullpen so maybe he becomes a surprise relief weapon in the playoffs</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> How about Brandon Lowe for one of Roupp/Birdsong?</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Franco:</strong> More than I&#x27;d give up for one year of Lowe Like the player and fit in SF though</p>
<p><strong>DodgerFan:</strong> Seeing the initial reports that Teoscar Hernández was being discussed on the trade market didn’t sit well with me, but after thinking it over, I can understand why the Dodgers might explore it. Two-part question:What kind of return could the Dodgers realistically get for Teo, and would they be able to move his full contract?Do you view Bader as a legitimate fit for an everyday center-field role, or is it more likely they fill that spot internally (Edman, Kim, Pages)?
