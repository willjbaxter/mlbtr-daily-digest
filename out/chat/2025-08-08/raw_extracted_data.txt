Hey everyone, hope you've all enjoyed your week! Looking forward to another of these, let's get going

====================

SPEAKER: Kevin in Tx

Does Texas rid themselves of Adolis Garcia this winter, his last year of arbitration, Iâm guessing a raise to about $12-17 million.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
It'd be much closer to 12 than 17. He's not getting an $8M arbitration raise coming off this kind of season. Agree that he's getting non-tendered anyways though

====================

SPEAKER: RoxTalks

Will Brandon Woodruff be extended the QO after he declines his end of the QO?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
He's got a $20M mutual option with a $10M buyout. Just clarifying what the questioner means by "declines his end" We'll see how he finishes the year but yeah, I think we're trending towards him receiving and declining the QO. Based on our FA deliberations this week, it seems like I'm the low person on staff about Woodruff's earning power, but there's a lot higher upside than there are with some guys who either received the QO last winter (Severino, Martinez) or signed for the same amount (Buehler) I feel like Eovaldi's 3/75 is the absolute ceiling and would have him more as a high-AAV two year guy right now, but others at MLBTR (especially Tim Dierkes) think there's a path to a much better deal than that if he shoves through the end of the season and into the playoffs

====================

SPEAKER: GWA

Are the Yanks cooked for 2025.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco

Eh, I still think they'll hang onto a Wild Card spot. The bullpen's better on paper than it has pitched. It's tough to feel great about them with how badly they've played for the better part of two months, but there's a lot of talent on the roster and they're still in playoff position right now

====================

SPEAKER: Alan V

Who gets your vote for worst owner in Baseball? It could come from Colorado, Anaheim, Pittsburgh, Miami, Oakland Or the Chicago White Sox.
