Let’s let a few questions pile up in the queue, and then get cooking….</p>
<p><strong>L’Chaim:</strong> Has there ever been an offseason where two teams linked up on three separate trades?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> While I don’t have an obvious answer off the top of my head, this isn’t too uncommon.  Just last winter, for instance, the Guardians and Blue Jays lined up on two trades.  The Rays, Mariners, and Padres used to have a pretty steady pipeline of trades going between each other.</p>
<p><strong>Guest:</strong> If the Cubs sign Bregman do they move Shaw? Will the Cubs sign Bregman?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Cubs’ focus seems to be on starting pitching, so if they have a particularly big move in them this winter, it’ll probably be in the rotation.Their interest in Bregman might be limited to seeing if he’s willing to take a shorter-term deal, or if a longer-term deal isn’t out there</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Is everyone waiting on Okomoto and Imai?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Things are usually fairly slow during the holiday season anyway, but yeah, these notable names having set deadlines might well have caused some delay in the broader market.  Probably Imai moreso than Okamoto.</p>
<p><strong>Fake and Real:</strong> Will there ever be another Ohtani? He seems to be the best overall player that there ever was.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Ohtani is definitely a one-in-one for now, but the fascinating next step of his legacy will be his influence on the next generation of players (in both Japan and all over the world).  Maybe a few more players will take the leap of trying to be real two-way players, and we’ll see a “new Ohtani” emerge….though then that player will have to be not just a two-way guy, but elite in both areas</p>
<p><strong>JJ Piccolo:</strong> Any chance KC is in the Ketel Marte market?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> This isn’t a bad fit, except for the Royals’ decision to tender Jonathan India a contract.  KC could try to move India elsewhere or flip him back to the D’Backs as part of the trade package and as salary offset, but a limited-payroll team like the Royals can’t so easily just eat $8MM (India’s salary for 2026).The Royals do have some interesting young arms that would seemingly be of interest to Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Pirates agreed to O’Hearn deal on the 23rd. It’s the 28th now and still not official and no corresponding 40 man move. Is this abnormal?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Not over the holidays, when a lot of front offices are more or less shut down</p>
<p><strong>Buster Posey:</strong> Please make some sense of the Giants offseason. We buy real estate and movie theatres but refuse to spend money on the team. I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> “What am I, chopped liver?” — Adrian HouserDon’t forget, last year’s offseason was also rather quiet apart from the Adames signing.  So it could be that Posey and company have one big move like that in mind, and the rest with be comparatively smaller additions like Houser</p>
<p><strong>Tarik Skubal:</strong> At this point, there’s 0% I get traded this offseason, right?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> It’s not zero, but it’s quite unlikely</p>
<p><strong>Joec:</strong> Are you surprised that there isn’t much sandy alcantara trade rumors?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Not really.  The Marlins have been pretty open about their desire to keep him, even if the team isn’t hanging up the phone if someone happens to call with an offer.  Given how shaky Alcantara was last year, the offers aren’t going to be what Miami wants, and the Fish are now quietly turning from rebuild/cost-cutting mode into trying to contend</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> would a Bello and Casas swap for Gore and Abram’s be a reasonable trade for both teams? Who would say no?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #999; font-style: italic;">... and 47 more exchanges</p></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><a href="../../index.html">← Back to All Posts</a><a href="#">Top ↑</a></div></div></body></html>
