SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Welcome to the Weekend Chat! We’ll start up once a few questions start piling into the queue…

====================

SPEAKER: Pirates 2026 World Series Champions
---
Pirates are 3-0 in spring training. Are they the greatest team of all time??

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Yes. The next CBA will be built around how to level competitive balance so powerhouse teams like Pittsburgh can be held in check.

====================

SPEAKER: Jason
---
What do you see with #4 and #5 starter for Braves.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’ll be Holmes and I guess Elder as the fifth for now?  Holmes I think can deliver a decent season but there’s a lot less confidence in Elder.  Martin Perez isn’t a bad placeholder for the fifth spot, or maybe the Braves can use multiple pitchers to patch things up until (or if?) the injured guys are back.Or, maybe the easiest solution is that Atlanta just signs a starter

====================

SPEAKER: Royals Fan
---
Local sports radio saying anything short of the playoffs for the Royals would be a disappointment.  I am not seeing it based on the lack of offseason movement.  Thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Tigers are the favorites in the ALC but I wouldn’t be shocked if the Royals won the division.  That might be an easier path to the playoffs than a wild card, since there are lots of good teams battling for those extra AL slots.The Royals have a good roster on paper, but I wish they’d gone bigger with their outfield upgrades.

====================

SPEAKER: Guards Fan
---
How much does Rhys Hoskins move the needle for the Guardians offense?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Speaking of teams that should’ve done more to help their lineup…..Hoskins has been decent over the last two years, with the caveats of injury rust and his thumb sprain perhaps preventing him from achieving greater heights.  Cleveland’s not really asking him to be anything more than a platoon bat provided that Manzardo and Kayfus hit as expected, though even as a platoon specialist, Hoskins isn’t exactly a lefty-masher.In short, don’t expect the Phillies version of Hoskins to suddenly re-emerge in 2026.  He’s a logical signing for the Guardians but probably not a difference-maker for a lineup that really needs it

====================

SPEAKER: Is a 102 ops+
---
Really that much better than a 98 ops +

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
/Nigel Tufnel voiceYeah, it’s four better.

====================

SPEAKER: Lloyd Dobbins
---
Suppose the Braves flop and miss the playoffs again in 2026. Does Alex Anthopoulus’s seat start to get warm?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not likely.  AA is under contract through 2031, and his track record with the team is strong enough to withstand even two rough seasons.

====================

SPEAKER: Campbell Soup
---
Do you think teams around the league have asked the Sox about Kristian Campbell?  Or is the long-term agreement something that would turn teams off / be unwilling to send something of value?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Sox surely haven’t given up on Campbell less than a year after making such a big financial commitment.  I’m sure some teams have made some creative offers, though you’re right in that Campbell’s extension kind of blocks out any “buy low” offers.

====================

SPEAKER: Marky Mark
---
Hey Mark, why not continue the trafition…what’s on the Playlist tonight??

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“Victim of Luck” by Metric

====================

SPEAKER: nick krall
---
i usually talk about the reds but what do you think about danny coulombe to the red sox? perfect fit in that bullpen and they are in need of LH relievers.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’d be a good fit, sure.  Frankly, I’m not sure why Coulombe hasn’t been signed yet, unless teams were scared off his age and his poor numbers after the deadline.

====================

SPEAKER: Ao
---
Jesus made debut this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He doesn’t turn 19 until May, though he has already gotten a handful of Double-A games under his belt.  If he just crushes it in Double-A and Triple-A, I could see Milwaukee maybe giving him a cup of coffee in September, but a 2027 debut is probably likelier.  The PPI will factor into the Brewers’ decision, assuming that the PPI will continue to exist in some form in the next CBA

====================

SPEAKER: Joe
---
Surprised that the best that Hoskins could get was a minor league deal from Cleveland, why the lack of interest from teams that still need help at first base?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Teams like the Nationals, Rockies, etc. aren’t trying to win in 2026.  Could be that Hoskins preferred a minors deal with a contender rather than a guaranteed deal with a worse team, plus there’s a strong chance Hoskins makes the Guardians’ opening roster

====================

SPEAKER: Astros71
---
Christian Walker bounce-back!!!

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That would be a huge help to Houston’s chances.  I love that signing for the Astros last winter, so I was as surprised as anyone that Walker struggled so mightily.  It’s possible he needed a year to adjust, but it would be rough for the team if Walker suddenly hit a wall in his mid-30’s

====================

SPEAKER: Slick Ric
---
Top to bottom, can you think of a pitching staff that is worse than Washington’s?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The 2025 Rockies had the worst rotation ERA in baseball history, so there’s that.  But Washington’s current rotation is indeed looking rough

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Will the dodgers hold up health wise? Where do u see a potential problem area

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If they lost one of their real tentpole players (Ohtani, Betts, Smith, Freeman, Tucker), that’s a big problem.  I’d say that a bunch of pitching injuries would also be a problem, but the Dodgers have such absurd pitching depth that they’ve been crushed by injuries to their arms in the last two years and still have two rings to show for it

====================

SPEAKER: PJ
---
What is your take on what the Astros do with Paredes? 2B? Trade? They cant possibly bench him right?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The situation will resolve itself as soon as one of the Astros’ infielders gets hurt, which will inevitably happen.  I can also see Houston using Altuve in LF a little more than they’re letting on.

====================

SPEAKER: NL East
---
Mets or Phils. Which is the better team?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Who has the better record in 2026?Mets(40.2% | 378 votes)Phillies(59.7% | 560 votes)Total Votes: 938

====================

SPEAKER: Brewers
---
good job on the brewers write up. you mention saves increase arbitration costs, does the fireman role make Megill more, less, or no difference in how likely they trade him in 26?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Having saves on his resume means that Megill will still get a decent raise next winter if he’s this year’s closer or not.  The Brewers might also be playing the long game in trying to limit Uribe’s save totals, in order to prevent him from having too large a first-time price tag once he becomes arb-eligible.All of this is next to the more obvious point that the Brewers are trying to win ballgames.  However Megill or Uribe are utilized this season, Megill probably isn’t being dealt until next winter, since the Crew usually move guys when they’re a year away from free agency (not two, as Megill is now)

====================

SPEAKER: Mike Elias
---
Do I trade Colby Mayo or keep him, since the Orioles have injuries?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Westburg/Holliday injuries probably close the door on a Mayo trade for now, given how Baltimore is suddenly short-handed in the infield

====================

SPEAKER: Baseball Savant
---
Jeff Passan thinks the history of the last time baseball was locked out will convince owners and players to compromise so that next season won’t be lost. Do you think a salary minimum is a legitimate bargaining point from the MLBPA perspective when combined with a mild version of a salary cap? The teams that spend the least make quite a bit of money because they get the taxpayers’ money. I don’t like the idea of a salary cap because it will limit teams like the Yankees, Dodgers, Cubs, etc. from making the game exciting by creating great teams on paper. There is enough history to know that WS aren’t won on paper.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The MLBPA will resist a salary cap in any form.  What’s interesting about a cap is that it has to have a salary floor as well, which (if I recall the NFL/NBA/NHL versions) is something like 90% of the cap high.If you’re referring to the same Passan column I’m thinking of, Jeff made the point that a salary floor will lead to a lot of consternation amongst owners.  Hypothetically, if a cap is something like $200MM, then an $180MM minimum spend isn’t something the Pirates, Guardians, A’s, Marlins, etc. are going to want to do.So it creates a bit of a catch-22 situation for all parties.  Plus there’s also the fact that teams would have to give the MLBPA full access to their books in order to accurately gauge a cap or floor based on league revenues, and teams don’t want to do that

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Baseball is still the greatest game!

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Agreed!

====================

SPEAKER: Bay Area fan
---
Don’t know too much about it, but I heard rumblings of the A’s having trademark troubles going to Vegas. Should they just abandon their name and start fresh going into their new city like the Expos did?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I admittedly haven’t been paying much attention to this story about the name trademark.  But for tradition’s sake, I’d like to see the A’s keep the name.  The “Athletics” brand is the only thing linking the franchise’s long history from Philly to KC to Oakland to Sacramento to Vegas.

====================

SPEAKER: J2A
---
Out of Pages, Hererra, Crooks, and pozo who is the primary catcher and who DH’s?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Herrera will catch as much as he can based on health and defensive capability, since he has a lot more value behind the plate than as a pure DH (even if he swings the bat well in any role).Pages will probably be the primary backstop until the Cardinals have a better gauge on Herrera’s situation, and the team will go from there.  For some of the talk about the Cardinals trading from this on-paper surplus, that depth suddenly dries up quickly if Herrera can’t really catch

====================

SPEAKER: Loveable losers
---
How worrisome is it that the Cubs need to re-up with at Nico, Seiya, Happ, Steele, Boyd, and Taillon

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This is by design, since it feels like the Cubs are preparing for some changes to baseball’s business structure in a new CBA.  How widespread these changes are remains to be seen, and of course there’s still a still a month of the 2026-27 offseason that will happen before the current CBA actually expires.Steele, btw, is a free agent after 2027.  The rest of the group are free agents after 2026.

====================

SPEAKER: Lou Whitaker’s HOF resume
---
What, exactly, is missing?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Your guess is as good as mine, since if I had my way, Whitaker would’ve been in Cooperstown years ago.

====================

SPEAKER: Jake Jortles
---
Assuming their average seasons (and that a QO is still a thing), does Toronto QO Bieber and Varsho?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Yeah.  Maybe some slight hesitation over Varsho since his “average season” is below average in terms of wRC+.  But overall, it’s a pretty safe call to think the Jays give a QO to a power-hitting center fielder with a superb glove

====================

SPEAKER: Zach
---
Where do you think Skubal will sign if not extended and is a free agent?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Dodgers are the obvious answer.  Having a rotation of Skubal/Yamamoto/Ohtani/Glasnow/Snell with Sasaki and all of the many younger guys as depth options sounds absurd, but this is the Dodgers we’re talking about.Beyond LA, it’ll be the usual suspects of the Mets, Blue Jays, Phillies, and other big spenders who can afford the gigantic number Boras and Skubal will be asking for

====================

SPEAKER: Jill
---
Will Cleveland make any more moves?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
MORE moves?  Hey come on now, you want more than Hoskins AND Austin Hedges?!

====================

SPEAKER: Jack Lazorko
---
Do you think the loss of their local TV contract has caused the Angels to cut payroll?   I’m not optimistic about this season at all.   The roster looks thin and poorly constructed.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s a factor, but it feels like Moreno in his own way is trying to have a quiet rebuild without really calling it as much.  Or, you know, going about a rebuild in the normal way of tearing down a roster and focusing solely on young talent.

====================

SPEAKER: Brewerfan
---
Did I miss it or did you guys not report Pat Murphy’s extension?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
You missed ithttps://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2026/02/brewers-pat-murphy-agree-to-ext…

====================

SPEAKER: Chris M
---
Why do you suppose it was so hard for the Royals to find a trade partner for their pitching depth? Like selling high on Noah Cameran

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
KC might’ve been asking for too much in return, or other teams were offering too little.  Even for teams with an apparent pitching surplus like the Royals, it’s tricky to line up on trades since teams are so loath to give up pitching

====================

SPEAKER: Brian
---
Do you think any of the Mets’ moves were rage spending after missing out on other players?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Stearns is a measured guy. He isn’t operating out of spite.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
After considering the injury history, does Luis Robert have anything to offer the Mets?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Assuming he stays healthy, Robert is (at minimum) a good defensive center fielder who hits left-handed pitching well.  That’s a useful player to have on the roster, even if it remains to be seen if he can recapture any of his past stardom

====================

SPEAKER: MoonBeamMcSwine
---
Can you provide a comment regarding “the Big Rig”, Gavin Williams.. could he challenge for league ace status & Cy votes during the 2026 season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Some back-end Cy votes certainly seem possible.  Williams had a nice breakout last year and might be the latest frontline arm from the Cleveland pitching factory.

====================

SPEAKER: CY
---
Shouldn’t I have sold them off instead adding Gore to the aging and injury prone DeGrom and Eovaldi?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
DeGrom and Eovaldi both have no-trade clauses, so they’d have to approve any deal anyway.  And, their ages and salaries and injuries are also obstacles to finding an acceptable return in a trade, though either would’ve certainly drawn interest if the Rangers had really shopped them The bottom line here is that the Rangers are still trying to compete in 2026, albeit within payroll restrictions.  Trying to thread the needle by moving DeGrom or Eovaldi for salary relief and some win-now return and then still (either in the same transaction or in others) filling those new holes at the top of the rotation is mighty difficult.

====================

SPEAKER: Kurtz on 1st
---
Who’s closing games for my A’s?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’ll apparently be a committee, though plans can change if one guy really stands out in a closing role.  Hogan Harris is probably (big if) the top closer choice at the moment, if the A’s do give one member of the committee a larger share of the save chances.

====================

SPEAKER: Pablo Lopez
---
Now that my season is over, what do the Twins do about the rotation? I’m not sure that Giolito or Littell move the needle much…

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Littell is probably the better fit since he’ll be less expensive. Since I was pessimistic about Minnesota’s chances even with Lopez healthy, losing him for the season seems like it should already get the front office thinking about another deadline selloff

====================

SPEAKER: AJ Preller
---
Are the Padres done dealing ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Based purely on vibes, I feel like Prelller has one more notable addition still to come before Opening Day.

====================

SPEAKER: Dark 🐎
---
Which team has been the most surprising to go on a run that wasn’t on anyone’s radar throughout the season? Maybe 2006 Cards?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Exactly nobody thought the 2023 World Series was going to wind up as Rangers vs. Diamondbacks, and yet…

====================

SPEAKER: Dark 🐎
---
Best under the radar off-season signing?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Since I hyped him for months as a great darkhorse signing, Luis Rengifo going to the Brewers gives me a lot of hope that he’s in for a very good year.  Milwaukee excels are under-the-radar adds, so the fact that they’re in on Rengifo says something.

====================

SPEAKER: Ian
---
Who wins the AL West this year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Seattle is the clear favorite. Astros/Rangers/A’s should all be competitive, with the A’s a tier below the Texas clubs since I don’t trust the Athletics’ rotation.As for the Angels, well….uh, it’s an affordable experience at your ballpark? Anecdote about the Anaheim ballpark experience!My parents were vacationing in California years ago (maybe around 2011?), and on a night when their tour group was doing something they weren’t interested in, my folks decided to randomly just take in an Angels game.  They remembered nothing about the game itself, but said the ballpark was nice, and there was a pregame promotion where two Angels players squared off in a cow-milking contest.

====================

SPEAKER: Rick Rude
---
Was the Twins FO delusional to think they could be competitive this season (at least before Lopez injury)? Do you think Buxton may eventually agree to a trade?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Buxton’s irritated comments the other day were perhaps some indication that he is rethinking his decision to stick it out in Minnesota.  That said, I’d still put a Buxton trade at at least 95% unlikely.

====================

SPEAKER: Ebenezer_Batflip
---
2013 red sox had no business being that good

====================

SPEAKER: Surprise
---
The 2019 World Champion Washington Nationals.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If we’re looking even more recently, the Blue Jays were terrible in 2024 before winning the pennant last year.

====================

SPEAKER: Don Zimmer
---
Have the Cubs done enough? Asking for a friend.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Chicago should reach the postseason at the very least.  Given how the Brewers took a step back on paper, winning the NL Central is certainly within the Cubs’ reach.

====================

SPEAKER: Tom
---
I thought JoJo Romero would have been traded by now?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Same here. Could easily still happen before Spring Training is over.

====================

SPEAKER: Yu
---
Is there any chance Murakami traded this year or next year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Unlikely.  It probably wouldn’t be great for the White Sox reputation-wise if they branched out for this notable international signing, Murakami plays well, and the Sox immediately dealt him as part of the rebuild.

====================

SPEAKER: Brian
---
Will the Phillies decline this year after losing Ranger and the star players getting another year older?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As per that survey from earlier, roughly 60% of Weekend Chat participants feel Philadelphia will still be better than the Mets, fwiwWhat’s interesting about Philly is that technically, they keep getting better. They’ve increased their win total in each of the last full (not counting 2020) MLB seasons.  The success just hasn’t paid off with a championship yet, and the playoff results have stalled out since their pennant in 2022.Phils fans could care less about regular-season wins, of course, since it’s title or bust.  There is some fear of the Phillies regressing due to the roster’s overall age, but the idea is that Crawford can give the lineup a jolt in the arm.  It also seems like not having Castellanos will help the team both on and off the field, so Adolis’ contributions will be welcomed.

====================

SPEAKER: Dan
---
Brewers didnt take a step back. This is right where all the beat writers had them last year toom.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ah, that’s why I said “on paper”Milwaukee just keeps figuring out ways to win, no matter how many stars they trade

====================

SPEAKER: Nick2112
---
What do you think of the job bloom is doing in the Lou ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Too early to tell, naturally.  Felt like Bloom has been going for quantity of prospects over quality, with the Cards also eating a good deal of money to ensure that they have gotten some quality in return.It’ll be years before we can gauge Bloom’s work properly, since so much of it depends on how the team drafts and develops, as well as future bigger-ticket moves like trades or signings.

====================

SPEAKER: Zakis
---
You spoke of Buxton having irritated comments earlier.  What exactly are you talking about?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-twins-byron-buxton-spring-traini…

====================

SPEAKER: ROYALS
---
If think people are really underestimating just how much of an upgrade the Royals OF will be this year.  They were SOOOOOOOOOO bad last year.  You could put a swarm of bees out there and it’d be an upgrade.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This a fair point.  Collins/Thomas don’t need to be world-beaters to top the dismal numbers posted by the 2025 Royals outfield (apart from Yaz).The issue is that Thomas is also coming off a dreadful 2025, and Collins had a promising rookie season but is far from a sure thing.  My preferred Royals offseason would’ve been Collins, and then a proven OF bat rather than Thomas. There’s also the Jac factor (or the Jac-tor, if you will), of hoping Caglianone will be markedly better.  It would be hard for him to be worse than his rookie year, yet counting on him to improve is a risk for a Royals team trying to win

====================

SPEAKER: Basket ball GEEK
---
Marlins may surprise people if the kids hit and pitching staff stays reasonably healthy…may give the Braves a run at least…also, Phillies pitching is suspect until Wheeler returns and pitches…. What do you think?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Marlins are one of the more interesting teams to watch in 2026.  Trading two starters doesn’t seem like the usual tactic for a team that truly plans on making a playoff push, but it’s still ultimately a building year.  Getting to a .500 record doesn’t seem out of the question for Miami, though I think it’ll take (another) perfect storm of struggling rival teams for the Marlins to get close to the playoffs. The Phillies are a team I’d consider as contenders for Giolito or Littell.  This moves Walker to the pen and adds some depth until Wheeler is ready, or if Painter isn’t ready for the Show

====================

SPEAKER: German Marquez
---
Am I a dark horse candidate for Improved Player of the Year in San Diego?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Stranger things have happened.  Ruben Niebla has worked some wonders in the past, but this would be his masterpiece.

====================

SPEAKER: Wally
---
Red sox #5 starter is?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Likely Oviedo I’m not entirely ruling out a Bello trade, which opens the door for one of Early/Tolle

====================

SPEAKER: Blake
---
Does Paredes to the Orioles make sense?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
For the moment, but Paredes would be going from one crowded infield to another once Westburg and Holliday returned. We’ve passed the two-hour mark, so it’s time to call it a night.
