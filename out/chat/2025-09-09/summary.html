We’ll get going at 1pm CT, but as always, feel free to send in questions ahead of time. Happy Tuesday all — let’s get rolling</p>
<p><strong>Bo Bichette:</strong> The Blue Jays cant really sign me if my price tag reaches $250-300 million right?  I mean you can barely call me a shortstop.  Any predictions?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don’t think anyone is going to sign Bichette at that price point. I suppose it’s always possible someone loses their mind and goes to Xander Bogaerts levels, but Bogaerts is the only prominently paid infield free agent who hit the market as a shortstop but with clear long-term doubts about his viability at the position. I have Bichette around $200MM flat, give or take $10-15MM either way, depending on market context, how he finishes, hits in the postseason, etc.I do think the Jays can afford to sign him long-term.</p>
<p><strong>87 champs:</strong> Why are the Twins collecting left-handed hitting outfielders, including their top prospects?  Are Larnach and Walbeck gone during the off season?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I’d be surprised if Larnach is back next year. They’ve had him for in the majors for parts of five seasons now, and he just kind of is what he is … defensively limited, big power, can’t hit lefties, good-not-great against righties.I don’t really understand why they acquired James Outman, particularly since he’s out of options next year, but I suppose he’ll be a fourth OF in 2026 with Buxton and two of Wallner/Jenkins/Rodriguez rounding things out (pending any offseason additions via trade or free agency — the former seemingly likelier than the latter)</p>
<p><strong>PhilsPhansince1965:</strong> Low and high projections for a Ranger Suarez deal this winter?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> I don’t see any reason he comes in under Eduardo Rodriguez’s four-year, $80MM deal, and I think he has a good case to push into the Kevin Gausman/Robbie Ray range of $22-23MM annually over five years.</p>
<p><strong>O’s close:</strong> Every time Ryan Helsley gets shelled with the Mets, his prospects for a big free agent contract fade. Looking like a 1-year pillow contract for a team desperate for a closer, like the Orioles, right?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> His stock was already down after a good-not-great run in St. Louis this year (still don’t know why they didn’t trade him in the winter). It comes down to a matter of preference for him, probably. I’m sure plenty of teams would love to “buy low” on a weighty one-year deal (still worth $10MM+). Helsley could go that route, try to rebound, and look for the big long-term deal next winter. But he’s already 31 (32 next July), and if he takes another step back, his chances of a lucrative long-term deal are shot.There are probably teams still willing to bet on the stuff and track record to put forth two- and three-year deals with more modest AAVs than he’d have gotten with a typical Helsley season. Does he want to go like 1/15 and try again, or would he take 2/26 or 3/30 and max out right now?Those are the scenarios I expect he’ll have to weigh.</p>
<p><strong>Don Kelly:</strong> Is there any chance the Pirates DON’T bring me back next year? If so what would be there reason not to. I’ve managed the team to a 0.491 win % as opposed to Shelty’s 0.316%</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> At this point, I’d be surprised if he’s not back. Your mileage may vary on whether that’s a good or bad thing, but I’m kind of in the “it doesn’t matter all that much as long as Nutting owns this team,” honestly.At the very least, I don’t think Kelly has done anything to hurt his chances of keeping the job for a few years beyond the current season.</p>
<p><strong>Merrill Kelly:</strong> How do you like my chances of a three-year deal?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> You can see in our handy Contract Tracker (cheap plug!) that he’d be just the third SP in the past decade to get three guaranteed years in a deal that starts with his age-37 season or laterhttps://www.mlbtraderumors.com/contracttracker?name=&amp;team=0&amp;position=S… I think two is far likelier (Scherzer and Rich Hill were the others … long live Mad Max and Dick Mountain)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Heywood:</strong> Bregman will surely opt out, does he stay or go? What does his next contract look like?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Yeah I don’t see any way he passes on the opt-out, barring some awful injury here in the final few weeks.Red Sox will be in the mix to keep him. Cubs, Tigers, Jays, Phillies all seem like viable alternatives. (I’d say Mariners, but they just don’t spend at this level on free agents under Dipoto)A five-year deal in the $160-170MM range feels safe/conservative, but I wouldn’t entirely rule out six years and $30MM+ annually.</p>
<p><strong>Guest:</strong> As a long-time Mets fan, it seems clear that a miss of the playoffs is looming over us 🙂  But should we make it, I know that Tong and McLean are eligible, but will Sproat be eligible for a playoff roster? Otherwise, this may be the most disastrous pitching staff the Mets assembled since the late 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> Sproat is eligible, yes. You just need to be in the organization. (I wrote as much in his promotion post the other week) We’ve seen prospects who weren’t on the 40-man roster make their MLB debuts in the playoffs (Alex Kirilloff, Shane McClanahan, Adalberto Mondesi)He’d need to be an injury replacement, technically speaking, but they have no shortage of IL guys whose postseason roster spot he could effectively take over.</p>
<p><strong>Matt M:</strong> Could the Padres look to dump Bogey? Say put him with Salas and J Estrada?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Adams:</strong> He’s still owed eight years and $200MM, beginning in his age-33 season, and has posted basically league-average offensive numbers, Even if they paired him with Salas and Estrada and told another team “He’s all yours if you take the contract,” I highly doubt they’d find a taker at that rate.They can try to dump him, but it’s among the least tradeable contracts in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> What does Schwarber next deal look like?  33 next year, with one + trait …</p>
