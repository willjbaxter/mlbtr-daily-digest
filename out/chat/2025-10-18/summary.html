While I wince at the missed opportunity, let’s take some of your questions and address some admittedly more relevant baseball topics!</p>
<p><strong>Ca$hman:</strong> Does Trent Grisham get a qualifying offer? Does he accept it if offered?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The Yankees will very likely extend the QO, and Grisham will surely turn it down.  Coming off such a big platform year, Grisham is looking for a pricey multi-year deal, not a one-year payday.</p>
<p><strong>Optimistic Giants Fan:</strong> What’s the crummiest bullpen thats ever won the World Series in your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Just from recent memory, the 2019 Nationals and 2023 Rangers didn’t exactly have great pens, though they had just enough relievers get it together for just long enough in October.</p>
<p><strong>Braves Fan:</strong> What will the Braves do at SS if Kim walks? Do we see Profar or Murphy traded to help fill that hole?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> The likelier scenario is that the Braves trade from their farm system or perhaps move a pitcher to land another shortstop.  Murphy doesn’t have a ton of trade value at this point, plus Atlanta might want to keep depth at catcher in case Baldwin has a sophomore slump.  Also, the Braves have to be thinking Murphy has a rebound in him, and THEN the club might be more inclined to deal him if Baldwin is firmly established as the top catcher.Profar’s PED suspension probably cooled a lot of teams on his services.  Plus, if the Braves dealt Profar, then that’s another hole to be addressed for left field.</p>
<p><strong>Brady:</strong> Do you think the Tigers should go all in this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Scott Harris has kept things pretty low-risk during his time in charge of the front office, so an all-in push in Skubal’s last year of control doesn’t seem likely.  Same with Tigers ownership, who seem content to keep spending in check.Granted, the team has made it to the ALDS in each of the last two seasons, so it’s not like things are going poorly in Motown.  But the ceiling for this team definitely seems higher, especially with an ace like Skubal in the rotation</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Will A. Garcia be a Rangers next year or trade bait?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Trade bait or probably even a non-tender.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Breslow:</strong> can you see me making a package deal with the Cardinals for Gray, Contreras and Wynn</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Cardinals aren’t going to move all their trade chips in one deal, and moving Winn doesn’t seem likely at all.</p>
<p><strong>Cal:</strong> Is Cal Raleigh the MVP?    Only 6 players have hit 60 homers.  And I am a catcher with a platinum glove. Who play 159 games</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> He’d be my pick, if I had a vote.  Judge’s numbers are overall better, but the degree of difficulty for a catcher hitting 60 home runs in that home ballpark is wild</p>
<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> What bats do the Pirates sign or trade for this offseason?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Spencer Horwitz-type players, in all likelihood.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing since Horwitz had a good year, and obtaining controllable young hitters is something the Pirates should absolutely be doing.Of course, what they also “should” be doing is being willing to spend more on hitting.  Until they do so, however, I’ll continue to assume they’ll keep looking for cost-effective bats rather than more proven talent</p>
<p><strong>Arte Moreno:</strong> Could you see Bo Bichette shifting to 3B or 2B this off-season?</p>
<p><strong>Mark P:</strong> Bichette’s arm isn’t great, so 2B seems to be the more likelier option if he is open to a position change.From both a financial and common-sense standpoint, it would make sense for Bichette to move off shortstop.  Being willing to play 2B opens the door for more potential suitors, plus it solves concerns about his glovework at short.</p>
<p><strong>TameImp:</strong> After a really rough postseason  – what is Luke Weaver looking at in FA? Less than what Holmes got last year?</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #999; font-style: italic;">... and 55 more exchanges</p></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><a href="../../index.html">← Back to All Posts</a><a href="#">Top ↑</a></div></div></body></html>
