Hey all, hope you're doing well! Steve and Darragh are getting killed by the waiver deluge today so I'll keep this one right around an hour to chip away at that after Let's get it rolling

====================

SPEAKER: Tigers lover

Thanks for the chat, Anthony! Scott Harris and the Tigers finally finally finally put their chips in and got Framber... and they had to, this next year might be their biggest opportunity, before they lose the best pitcher in the game. With these guys now as Tigers' one-two punch, how do you rank American League contenders?

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Yeah love this for them, finally showed a sense of urgency to win now. I expected them to add a starter but figured it'd be more in the Bassitt/Giolito range Clear team to beat in the Central. They were before really, but this just widens the gap. I don't think there really is a hierarchy of AL contenders. Guess I'd give the edge to Seattle as the best team but it's as muddled as any year I can remember If you wanted to argue for the Tigers or any non-Rays team in the AL East for that spot, I wouldn't have much pushback. Baltimore's probably a stretch with that pitching staff but wouldn't be all that surprising if they mash their way back to the top of the division either

====================

SPEAKER: Rays Apologist
---
Do the Rays still sign one of the free agent lower tier starters or are they pretty much finalized as a squad now? Was hoping for a Littell reunion.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
I think there's one more coming. Boyle's probably not a starter. I like Seymour but there's not much after that if he wins the fifth starter job. Littell would make sense, sure

====================

Hello Anthony. The Red Sox can’t be done can they? I know the pickings are getting slim. They need a RH power bat desperately. Are Tyler O’Neill or Nick Castellnos options? I’m assuming it wouldn’t cost much of a package to acquire either one of them.

====================

SPEAKER: Anthony Franco
---
Seems like Contreras was the righty power bat. TON or Castellanos wouldn't get much playing time If you want to wait for the Phillies to release Castellanos, sign him for the minimum and cut Yoshida, maybe that could work. It'd add a little bit of balance. Is Castellanos signing up for that when he can decide where he wants to go because everyone's offering him the same salary? I don't know

Does 6 years and $120 million get Nico Hoerner back to the Cubs?
