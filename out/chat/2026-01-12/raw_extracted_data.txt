SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Weekend Chat has been launched! Let’s open up the queue to see what’s what…

====================

SPEAKER: Charkip
---
Who says no, Jordan Lawlar to the Guardians and Chase DeLauter to the DBacks

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Probably both teams, but Cleveland moreso.

====================

SPEAKER: Tigers Fan
---
Why haven’t we heard any talk about the Tigers trying to extend Casey Mize?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It could be that these talks are happening and both sides are staying quiet, but Mize is something of a tricky player to evaluate for extension purposes.  He’s only had a couple of (mostly) healthy seasons and pitched well, but not necessarily front-of-the-rotation well.I’m sure Mize feels like he can hit another level, and hitting that level in 2026 lines him up nicely in free agency next winter.  So he might not want to lock himself down to an extension now.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Bellinger will get more or less than Bregman?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I probably shouldn’t doubt Boras’ ability to work his magic, but I think it’ll be less

====================

SPEAKER: Squints
---
As a Brewers fan, is there any rebuttal to the Cubs recent moves?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Brewers aren’t ever going to outspend the Cubs, but that hasn’t stopped Milwaukee from beating them in the past.  I’m not sure I’d necessarily even pick Chicago for first in the Central right now.

====================

SPEAKER: Scott S
---
What type of package should the Brewers receive from a Freddy Peralta trade? Which teams seem to be most interested?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Peralta is so inexpensive that pretty much any contender in the league would or should want him.The most popular comp for a Peralta trade package is the Corbin Burnes package: a MLB-ready position player, an MLB-ready pitcher, and a draft pick (or another minor leaguer, if the Brewers are dealing with a team that doesn’t have a tradeable Competitive Balance Pick). Given how Peralta is also making a little more than half of Burnes’ salary in his final arb-eligible season, the Brewers may well ask for more in a trade return.

====================

SPEAKER: Bregman
---
Think the Cubs will do the Red Sox a solid and trade Hoerner to Boston?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Bregman signing makes a Nico trade slightly more likely, but if I’m the Cubs, I keep everyone for the sake of depth.  Injuries are inevitable, and there are worse ideas than having Moises/Shaw/Alcantara as the all-younger bench core.

====================

SPEAKER: I got friends in Lowe places
---
Any thoughts on where Nathanial Lowe lands?

====================

SPEAKER: hiflew
---
Any rumblings about the Rockies plans at 1B?  Is the plan to hope for Charlie Condon to win the job in the spring?  They only have Blaine Crim otherwise.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Hey, two questions in one fell swoop!  Lowe’s list of potential landing spots is pretty thin, but a one-year deal in Colorado seems like as decent a spot as any.  Condon has only 55 Double-A games under his belt, so an Opening Day job seems a little unlikely.  The Rockies should be as patient as possible with Condon.

====================

SPEAKER: Framber & Ranger
---
When and where are we finally going to sign?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This is a purely speculative pipe dream of mine, but I wonder if the Marlins could be a dark horse for either of these guys.  Miami can add another frontline starter to replace Cabrera, and boost the payroll enough to avoid an MLBPA grievance.But, in a more realistic world, the Orioles make a lot of sense for either guy.  Can’t rule out the Mets, maybe the Padres if they move some money, maybe even the Yankees or Red Sox.

====================

SPEAKER: Bo
---
Bichette to Phillies seems like a SOLID fit

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s not a perfect fit since it then essentially means the Phils have to move Bohm or Stott.  But, since Bichette is also way better than either of these guys, you’re right.

====================

SPEAKER: Enrico Pallazo
---
With Ketel reportedly off the trading block, what do you think the timing and return of a Donovan trade would be?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Bregman’s signing might open things up for a Donovan trade in the next couple of weeks, since now you figure Boston might make a larger push (not that the Sox are the only Donovan suitor by a long shot).I also have my doubts that Marte is truly off the market.  That might be a little bit of gamesmanship from Mike Hazen to try and spur better offers.

====================

SPEAKER: Carl
---
Who says no, Brendan Donovan for Bryce Eldridge?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Giants in a heartbeat. They’re not moving a top prospect for two years of Donovan.

====================

SPEAKER: Tony Fernandez
---
Wouldn’t the jays be better off trying to get a deal done with Bo as opposed to Tucker?  Tucker is clearly the better player, but in addition to costing more his arrival would mean one of springer, varsho, Santander, okamoto or Barger would have to take a seat.  Bringing Bo back lets those big bats all stay in the line up and Clement moves to the bench…which also solves the jays need for a bench bat that can play SS and 2b

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Toronto has enough multi-positional guys that they’d sign Tucker and let the rest figure itself out.  If that means keeping Santander as a very expensive part-timer, so be it.

====================

SPEAKER: John
---
Followup – Bellinger to the Mets all but guaranteed now?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They seem to be a pretty interesting contender, since the rest of his public suitors (Cubs, Dodgers, Jays, Phillies, Giants) have either made other moves, are imperfect roster fits, or are the Angels (Angels). If this Yankees/Bellinger stalemate is for real and neither side is blinking, that opens the door for the Mets to perhaps swoop in on Bellinger, who checks a lot of boxes on that team.It also might free up the Yankees to spend their dollars on a Suarez or Valdez rather than on Bellinger.

====================

SPEAKER: Tim
---
So the Tigers are just going to let Skubal walk after next season and take the pick?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Probably, unless the team isn’t in contention at the deadline and moves him then.But, I expect Detroit to contend for the AL Central again, and perhaps beyond.  If you’re a Tigers team trying to win, why not keep Skubal, since having arguably the best pitcher in the world on your team gets you a lot closer to a World Series

====================

SPEAKER: rockies
---
the McCarthy trade means Doyle is gone? Or do they run it with Moniak, Veen, Doyle, Beck, Freeman, AND McCarthy?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There’s probably as much of a chance that the Rox move any of Moniak/Veen/Beck than they do Doyle.  Remember, DePodesta didn’t draft Veen or Beck, so if he doesn’t evaluate them highly, he might be more inclined to move them while they have some “top prospect” sheen.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Do you see a chance the yanks get Bo to play 2nd and extend Jazz but move him to 3rd?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That creates the question of what’s to be done with Ryan McMahon.  Also, the Yankees generally don’t do extensions, as a franchise rule — I’d be stunned if they locked up Jazz or anyone to an extension.

====================

SPEAKER: Skubal arbitration
---
Reports say Boras is going to use a seldom used clause that allows final arb eligible players to comp to free agent contracts. How much would Skubal get on a 1 year free agent contract? Do you think Skubal wins his arbitration hearing?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think the Tigers win, just because I’m not sure the panel will want to give Skubal such a precedent-shattering salary.This is another reason why a Skubal trade might be unlikely, at least until the hearing is over.  It would be mighty awkward for a team to trade for Skubal, then immediately go into a contentious arbitration and arguing “well, he’s not THAT good…”If Skubal was magically a free agent now and was limited to one-year deals, he would also easily clear $32MM.

====================

SPEAKER: Your Average Terrified Mariner Fan
---
How many mlb games do you think Colt Emerson plays next year?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I can see him being up pretty early in the season, if perhaps not by Opening Day.  Obviously this equation changes if the M’s bring in an everyday 2B/3B type to crowd up the infield picture.Maybe 81 games for Emerson?

====================

SPEAKER: Bob
---
Who gets the better return? One year of Hoerner or two years of Donovan?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Donovan

====================

SPEAKER: Tim
---
is Alec Burleson the Cardinals first baseman next year? Or did the Cardinals spend 5 to 6 million for rhys hoskins?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Burleson will get every opportunity for everyday at-bats.  St. Louis is in a rebuild and will prioritize giving their younger guys chances. Put another way, the Cards aren’t moving Contreras to open up first base just to sign someone like a Hoskins to cut into Burleson’s playing time

====================

SPEAKER: A.Judge
---
Realistically how many solid years do I have left before my inevitable decline? One, maybe two?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Define “decline.”  Judge is one of the biggest multi-year heaters in baseball history.  If he drops back to being only (only!) the 155 wRC+ player he was from 2017-21, that’s both a decline on paper, and still numbers that put Judge into the MVP race.The point is, Judge is such a special hitter that he may be beyond the realm of normal aging curves.

====================

SPEAKER: David
---
Why don’t the Dodgers just make Rushing the full-time LF and sign a true backup catcher?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Rushing played 31 minor league games in left field in 2024, and two in 2025.  It seems like the experiment is probably over, plus it’s asking a lot of Rushing to take on an everyday role at what is still a new position while he is still figuring out how to hit MLB pitching.

====================

SPEAKER: Beano
---
What’s the latest on Louis Robert and K Tucker? I really thought the Sox would’ve move Robert by now and I certainly thought Tucker and Bellinger would have new homes by now?  I can’t recall – is it odd that the some of the  top names in the FA/to be traded group are still out there?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s not at all unusual, especially since Boras represents so many top guys and he is not shy about letting his clients’ markets play out deeper into the winter.  And even then, you saw Boras clients Cease and Alonso both sign relatively early.

====================

SPEAKER: Guardians
---
What do you expect from Cleveland for the rest of the offseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
One or two low-tier acquisitions, probably one for the lineup and for one for the rotation.

====================

SPEAKER: Chicago Fan
---
Better chance of winning a championship in the year 2026: Cubs or Bears?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As a Packers fan, this question really made me grit my teeth.  My answer is the Cubs, since the Bears’ next opponent probably won’t decide to phone in a half of football.

====================

SPEAKER: Bendix
---
What would you grade the Marlins in the Cabrera trade? Caissie seems like another young player to add to a nice young core.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I like the deal for Miami.  Caissie is the kind of blue-chip prospect you want to get back for a pitcher with Cabrera’s upside and years of team control.

====================

SPEAKER: Southside Sox Fan
---
Good evening Mark, Go Bears first off.  I think the White Sox take a few steps forward this season and possibly (with some luck) challenge for a wild card entry in the playoffs. Do you see the White Sox winning 80+ games this season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Sox will need to do a lot more with their roster to get anywhere close to 80 wins.  This club still lost 102 games last year, don’t forget.

====================

SPEAKER: Dodger Dog
---
Do you think transitioning Shohei to play 1st base when Freeman’s contract expires would work? It would free up a spot for another bat at DH, and he could still pitch.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ohtani is a good enough athlete that he could probably adjust to 1B pretty easily (/insert Moneyball clip here), or play some outfield.  But, the Dodgers also aren’t going to do anything to overload Ohtani’s already-historically unusual workload

====================

SPEAKER: Nationals Fan
---
There was a lot of buzz earlier this offseason that MacKenzie Gore would be traded, but there hasn’t been much news about it since. Do think it is still likely?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
My stance on Gore hasn’t changed.  Washington isn’t going to move him unless they get the moon and stars in return, since the Nats have no immediate need to move him now.

====================

SPEAKER: Baffled by the Bay
---
Darragh and Steve laughed about the Giants’ offseason during the most recent podcast.  Do you think they’ll do anything that isn’t laughable this offseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I find it hard to believe that the Giants won’t do anything kinda notable, but it has been an extremely quiet offseason. Maybe they’re lurking in the Bellinger (or even the Tucker?) markets. Acquiring a second baseman also suddenly makes their winter look at lot better.

====================

SPEAKER: WSoxFan
---
Any chance the White Sox trade Robert before the season begins?  I’d really like Braden Montgomery to have a chance to break camp as the new Sox CF, but with Robert there is no need for the additional OF.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Montgomery has only 34 Double-A games under his belt, so bringing him right up to the Show by Opening Day seems aggressive.  As with the Rockies and Condon earlier, Chicago should be in no huge rush to get their top prospects in the majors in early 2026.If Robert is still the White Sox beyond the trade deadline, Montgomery could be called up to play another outfield spot, to ease him into the big leagues.  Or, Robert could be moved into a corner spot.

====================

SPEAKER: Teddy
---
Christian Walker for catcher Keibert Ruiz and infielder Luis Garcia (INF)? Astros get luxury tax relief, a backup catcher and a solid bat. Nationals clear their books and make room for Harry Ford behind the plate.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Walker has $40MM left on his contract and Ruiz $35MM, so the Nationals wouldn’t be saving all that much money, even with Garcia added.  Also, the Nats have barely anything on the payroll ledger anyway, so it’s not like they need to clear salary space.The answer to the Ford/Ruiz situation will just be that Ford starts and Ruiz is (an overpaid) backup.  While the Nats do need a 1B, they’re more likely to pursue a Rhys Hoskins type as a stopgap. And, not to pile on, but another flaw in this proposal is that Garcia doesn’t have a place to play in Houston

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Do you think the Royals stand pat, or is there a legitimate trade partner for Kris Bubic or Noah Cameron?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Plenty of teams would or should be in on both pitchers.  It’s just a question of finding a match that also lines up with what KC wants (i.e. offensive help)

====================

SPEAKER: Arthur Rhodes
---
Luis rengifo the perfect buy low for the M’s to help the young guys at 3rd and 2nd?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I may be the president of the Rengifo fan club, so I’d personally like that signing for the M’s.  Seattle fans may be underwhelmed considering the alternatives of Polanco, Donovan, Marte, etc., and I wonder if the Mariners’ own front office evaluates Rengifo highly enough to give him playing time over the in-house prospects

====================

SPEAKER: G
---
Braves are going to get a SP right????? Who you got going to Atlanta for their staff?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
At this rate, I think the Braves will simply sign every reliever in baseball, and solve their run-prevention issues that way.

====================

SPEAKER: Lylesbay
---
whats the holdup with tucker, with soto last year it got done quickly, are teams mulling over tucker’s projection? it seems what reporters said about him has many gm’s scared, even his supposed $400M ask is slipping into $300’s

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Soto has a much stronger track record than Tucker, plus several big-market teams involved in his bidding war.  This offseason, the Mets, Yankees, etc. aren’t as keen to spend big money, leaving Tucker’s market more than a little uncertain.For all of the reports that Toronto might be a frontrunner for Tucker, for instance, the Jays might not be willing to offer him a desired contract if they feel they’re bidding against themselves.

====================

SPEAKER: Johnny 5
---
Shouldn’t the Rockies of all teams be the team willing to take on bad contracts for prospects? They have room and roster space. Take fliers to pick up lottery prospects and if any value is recouped flip the player?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Agreed.  Bryant/Tovar are the only players under contract beyond 2026, so the Rockies should be trying to get talent into the system even if it means eating some money.Like, the Phillies aren’t going to attach a top prospect to Castellanos or something, but for someone in their second or third tier of prospects? Sure.

====================

SPEAKER: Nick S
---
Do you think the A’s will be able to sign one of Chris Bassitt or Lucas Giolito for their rotation?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I have trouble believing any pitchers with options elsewhere will sign with the A’s, barring a drastic overpay.

====================

SPEAKER: Patrick
---
Are the Pirates done with adding to the lineup? I know it’s not great but it’s much improved especially considering they have the top offensive prospect in baseball. If money is tight, I’d rather add a veteran starter.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Cherington said the other day that the team is still looking for a third baseman or shortstop.  Adding such a player on a short-term deal could work, while still allowing for enough dollars to bring in a veteran arm. (Jose Quintana, come on down!)

====================

SPEAKER: Alec bohm
---
What’s my trade value?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not that much.  I even listed Bohm as a non-tender candidate back when I did the Phillies offseason outlook last fall, because just cutting him seemed like a better idea than struggling on the trade market or paying him $10.2MM

====================

SPEAKER: Green Monster
---
Is Bregman’s signing with the Cubs at all a reflection of ownership cheapness or front office incompetence in Boston, or did the Cubs just overpower the Red Sox with a great offer?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
According to reports, Boston’s offer also had a lot of deferred money but spread out over a much longer period of time.And, the lack of a no-trade clause seemed like an issue of Bregman.  This is speculative on my part, but I wonder if seeing what happened with Devers last year made Bregman wary about committing with the Sox unless they gave him no-trade protection.

====================

SPEAKER: Bloom
---
Who’s taking jojo Romero off my hands?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Hard to say, since tons of teams could use a solid lefty reliever.

====================

SPEAKER: PhilsPhansince1965
---
Has the JT Realmuto / Phillies standoff become a real concern, or is it still strictly business?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As noted in a recent chat, Realmuto’s last free agent deal with the Phillies wasn’t signed until late January 2021.  We’re still over a couple of weeks away even from that point, so I wouldn’t get too antsy about things yet.  Until Realmuto actually signs elsewhere or the Phils obtained another catcher, the greatest likelihood is that JTR will be back in Philly

====================

SPEAKER: Guards fan
---
Guardians reporter for the Athletic, Meisel, has been linking Austin Hays to them as a right handed OF bat to try to help balance their lefty heavy lineup. Have you heard any thing about this or another right handed bat, perhaps?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Hays would be a really good fit to give the Guardians some cover in case the kids aren’t ready for the majors yet.

====================

SPEAKER: Larry Wayne
---
AA has systematically addressed all the needs and the roster looks Opening Day ready. He has said he wants a little more starting pitcher depth but our starting 5 are really good IF they stay healthy (one of these years they have to, right?). We also have Holmes, Elder and about 10 minor league starters who could get a look and chance to stay. Some with big upside. Another experienced starter would be a luxury and not a necessity at this point. All of that being said, he will not sign anyone with a draft pick attached so give me a best shot FA name other than Bassit that could fit the mold.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I kinda joked about this earlier, but the Braves having such a deep bullpen now makes their need for a starter a little less glaring.  As you noted, Atlanta has a lot of rotation options at least from a pure depth perspective, even if obviously adding another proven starter would help alleviate the injury concerns over Sale, Lopez, etc.Bassitt would basically a perfect fit for Atlanta.  Verlander too.

====================

SPEAKER: WBC
---
I know a lot of fans bellyache about the Classic but I really enjoy it and think it’s great for the game. What are your thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’m a big fan of the WBC, and am eagerly looking forward to this year’s tournament

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P GM
---
You need an ace-type SP.  Would you feel more comfortable signing Framber Valdez or Ranger Suarez if the contract were the same?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’d prefer Suarez. Imagine a team of five Ranger Suarezes in the rotation and nine Luis Rengifos around the diamond. I’d never lose!

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Barger to the Pirates? Good move?  Or is Bohm more likely?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
There is basically zero chance the Jays would trade Barger.  Bohm is vastly more likely, and while that’s technically an upgrade for Pittsburgh, I think they can do better.

====================

SPEAKER: Jh
---
guardians picking bazzana first overall instead of nick kurtz has to get some ppl fired right?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Seems drastically early to be making that call

====================

SPEAKER: Cool
---
Is it just a weird coincidence that the Red Sox have not signed a free agent to a major league deal, or is there something deeper there?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Boston has gotten weirdly conservative in free agency, but it’s not like they haven’t been actively making notable moves on the trade front.Tonight’s chat queue has plenty of “the Sox are doomed” types of messages, but I disagree.  Maybe this is 25 years of watching things just seem to work out for Boston sports teams, but the Red Sox are still a good team as presently constructed, and there’s still plenty of time left in the offseason to make a few moves.  Bregman leaving is hardly the end of the world.

====================

SPEAKER: Drew Rasmussen
---
Will the rays let me throw more pitches this year? I’m sick of being pulled on low pitch counts.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“Twice through the order, then out” has become a common tactic throughout the sport, but in Rasmussen’s case, the Rays were naturally being cautious given his health history.  Rasmussen still tossed 150 innings last year, so if all goes well, he should be used somewhat more normally in 2026

====================

SPEAKER: Hunter Green
---
Do I play for Cincy or somewhere else

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Cincinnati. The Reds aren’t moving him unless they got an absolute haul in return.

====================

SPEAKER: Elias
---
Why am I not adding more to the bullpen given all the other additions I’ve made?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Helsley and Kittredge are already notable additions.  Still plenty of time for the O’s to get after more relievers, if even some lower-cost types

====================

SPEAKER: Blue Heaven
---
Was it the toughest PO lost for Packers, especially lost against Bears?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Green Bay’s season was over the moment Parsons got hurt, so I didn’t think they beating the Bears anyway.  It’s funny, people don’t usually mention the Packers when it comes to gut-wrenching playoff losses, but they’ve had some doozies in the last 20 years.  Granted, that one Super Bowl win eases the pain a bit…

====================

SPEAKER: AJ
---
Who should I reasonably ask Breslow for Tatis?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Tatis has a no-trade clause, which might turn off the Red Sox as much as Tatis himself might it use it to block any dealsThe Padres aren’t moving Tatis, as Preller said last month.The asking price would be so high that I don’t see the Sox meeting it, even if Preller threw in Yoshida/Hicks as salary offset. Tatis has a no-trade clause, which might turn off the Red Sox as much as Tatis himself might it use it to block any deals The Padres aren’t moving Tatis, as Preller said last month. The asking price would be so high that I don’t see the Sox meeting it, even if Preller threw in Yoshida/Hicks as salary offset.

====================

SPEAKER: Zach
---
What kind of contract is Marcell Ozuna going to get?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
If anything, a one-year deal worth maybe $8MM or so? Reflection of his age, down numbers in 2025, and lack of defensive value

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
How come guardians and dodgers hardly do a deal together?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Because I’m a big baseball nerd, I’ve absolutely spent time on B-Ref’s baseball trade histories page, to idly check out which teams are or aren’t common trade partners.The Amed Rosario/Noah Syndergaard deal from 2023 is the only player-for-player swap between the two teams in the last 11 years, though they’ve had some cash considerations deals.  I can only assume the lack of action is lingering hate from the 1920 World Series.

====================

SPEAKER: Tony Vitello
---
If the Giants signed Bichette would the talk of their poor offseason flip completely? Would that move be enough?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
No question.  These chats all winter have been full of comments ripping on the Cubs for their lack of action, but unsurprisingly, those have dried up this week.

====================

SPEAKER: Mike Trout
---
Doesn’t seem like we’ll be good anytime soon. Any other HOF caliber players to play on such bad teams their entire career?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ernie Banks leaps to mind

====================

SPEAKER: Luis Arraez
---
Am I still an option at 2B? While they should be concentrating on power, the Red Sox have a need at second base…

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Arraez can play 2B, but he’s just not a good defender.  In addition to providing zero power and few walks, Arraez’s limited skillset makes him a tough sell

====================

SPEAKER: Angels Fan
---
After restructuring the Rendon contract to pay out over five years and shedding Taylor Ward’s salary, Angels fans were hopeful Arte Moreno would sign an impact free agent. Instead, he has so far committed less than $15M in free agent spending this year. Perry Minasian refuses to discuss payroll or spending levels but it certainly seems the Angels are reducing payroll, possibly significantly. Am I right?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
You’re right.I’d stated in the past that the Angels are in the position where they’d have to overpay a premium player to sign, since a premium player who has options elsewhere will or should naturally have misgivings about playing for a franchise that is stuck in such a rut.  And if you’re the Angels with their track record, “overpaying” for a free agent target is a particular risk.So now they’re in this limbo of not really wanting to pay big prices in the first place, but needing to in order to attract even second-tier free agents, let alone top-shelf guys.  And, the cupboard is pretty bare in terms of trade chips.  Tough situation for the Halos (and, even moreso, their fans) I lost track of time, and only just realized we’ve sailed over the two-hour mark.  Time to wrap things up for this week’s chat.
