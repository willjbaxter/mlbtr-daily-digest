SPEAKER: Mark P

Hello, Weekend Chat chatters!  We’ll open up the question bag in a minute, so get your comments in…

====================

SPEAKER: Brett
---
Freddy Peralta for River Ryan and Eduardo Quintero.  Who says no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Brewers, without hesitation

====================

SPEAKER: Jed Hoyer
---
Matt Shaw to St. Louis for Brendan Donovan. Who says no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Cubs, since I think they value Shaw more highly than two years of Donovan.  Also, the chances of a Chicago/St. Louis trade of this magnitude are very, very low.

====================

SPEAKER: Preller
---
Am I going to surprise people with a free agent strike? Maybe framber with opt outs?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This seems like a possibility, but then again, it seemed like Suarez was perhaps heading into short-term/opt-out territory until he landed that deal from Boston that beat expectations.

====================

SPEAKER: Yankees
---
What was it about the Yankees that they didn’t make an all-out push to sign Imai?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They just didn’t value him that highly?  Probably just as simple as that.

====================

SPEAKER: Dan S.
---
Most likely to move: Peralta, Gore, Lodolo or Bubic?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Just my two cents, but from most to least, I’d rank them Bubic, Peralta, Gore, Lodolo.The Reds’ rotation is such their bread-and-butter that I don’t see them moving any of their big three.  Gore is probably staying put this offseason, but the trade deadline could be a different story.

====================

SPEAKER: Jagger
---
Do you think the Reds trade Brady Singer? he’s only under contract for 1 more season before hitting FA. I would think the Reds would like to get something in return for him.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He has long seemed like the most logical Reds starter to be on the move, but no deal to date.  Doesn’t mean a trade couldn’t still happen in the next few weeks, but it’d be interesting to see what kind of significant bat (if any) the Reds could acquire for one season of a solid starter but one who probably projects as a back-end starter on a good team In general, Singer isn’t the type of pitcher who’s a lock to start a playoff game.  Teams are only willing to give up so much for such a player.

====================

SPEAKER: Cj james
---
Braves are unlucky again with Kim. They will have to get someone else right

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not necessarily, since Dubon can fill in on a temporary basis.  Kim’s recovery timeline of 4-5 months is broad enough that if he’s “only” going to be out until mid-May, Atlanta might just roll with Dubon until then at shortstop.  But, the Braves will likely pick up a veteran backup infielder type heading into spring training

====================

SPEAKER: Stafford
---
Why aren’t more teams tanking/rebuilding with the lack of parity in MLB.  Specifically the Angels…they can’t even outspend their problems!

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Over the last three seasons, 22 of MLB’s 30 teams have made the playoffs at least once.  There’s plenty of parity.

====================

SPEAKER: Ross Atkins
---
Do I have any interest in a Brendon Donovan/ Jojo Romero sweap

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Both would fit in Toronto, but the Jays have enough utility infield types that Donovan probably isn’t a priority (and especially not at the Cardinals’ asking price).  Romero would be the better fit of the two.

====================

SPEAKER: Mike
---
Wilbur wood passed.  I saw him pitch for the seattle rainier.  He had a nice mlb career.  He pitched 300 innings plus a number of times.  Will we ever see a pitcher get 300 innings again?  I was 9 when I saw him in the old six stadium

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Barring a major sea change in how teams develop and handle pitchers, we won’t see anyone even approach 300 innings again.  It’s rare to see a pitcher even crack the 200-inning mark these days.

====================

SPEAKER: o-birds
---
The Orioles rotation still needs help is Elias going to do something Verlander is not the answer either

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
…does the strikethrough mean you disagree with your own take?  I agree that Verlander isn’t a huge upgrade over what the O’s already have, but he would be a decent add

====================

SPEAKER: Dread Pirate Roberts
---
I think the Mariners should roll with Young and Williamson again in the early part of the season and evaluate at the deadline.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
This might be what Seattle just ends up doing.  Between these two and Emerson making his MLB debut at some point, that could be enough for the M’s to get by, providing that the rest of the lineup delivers.  If not, and Young/Williamson still aren’t hitting, it’s a problem.

====================

SPEAKER: Dave Dombrowski
---
How badly did I miscalculate?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Phillies did what everyone expected in re-signing Schwarber and JTR.  And, Adolis was added for RF and the bullpen was shaken up a little via the Keller signing and the Strahm trade.So far, I’m not sure this Philly offseason counts as a “miscalculation” in any major sense.  If you’re talking about the team’s approach with Bichette, a seven-year offer perhaps just wasn’t on Bichette’s radar….it was either a mega-deal, or a shorter-term pact with opt-outs. As much as Dombrowski has a history of big moves, it might very well be that he’s seen this Phillies team has essentially done in terms of heavy lifting for a couple of years now, to the point where the “new” additions are extending and re-signing the building blocks.  Obviously signing Bichette would’ve counted as a big shake-up, but perhaps coming to those talks somewhat late just didn’t give the two sides enough time to develop a workable arrangement

====================

SPEAKER: Dallas
---
Pirates finished with 71 wins last year with barely any hitters over 100 wRC+. Adding in OHearn and Lowe should really help them. Could they realistically content for a WC spot and if not, what is holding them back?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think they’ve got a decent shot at a wild card as presently constructed.  I’d like to see one more notable bat added to really spark things upwards, however.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Any chance the Jays make a push for Framber or Bellinger after missing out on Tucker?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ben Nicholson-Smith’s report the other day indicated that the Jays’ contact with Valdez happened two months ago, before Cease or Ponce signed.  So Valdez likely isn’t happening, unless somehow Berrios is traded.Bellinger I can still see as a viable maybe, but the Blue Jays are probably there with the NY teams in being wary about giving Bellinger six+ years (I almost wrote “6-7 years” there.  Sorry, kids.)

====================

SPEAKER: Mets Infield
---
Polanco at 1st for the first time and Bo at 3rd for the first time; is the Mets’ infield going to be a calamity? There are sure to be growing pains, no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s an odd arrangement for a team that went into the offseason preaching better defense.  The open DH spot can do a lot of heavy lifting in giving people partial off-days and allowing for some better glovesmen to get into the field, but it’ll be a work in progress.

====================

SPEAKER: The Big Q
---
You being bombarded with Dodgers/lockout/salary cap questions right now?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not any greater extent than usual

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
I hear the Yankees viewed Imai as a reliever too, which they probably didn’t want to spend too $$$ on.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That’s true, Jon Heyman had that item in a recent report

====================

SPEAKER: Mitchell
---
Saw people in the Nationals online community discussing Rhys Hoskins as a possible signing for 1B. That kind of move would make sense to me, what do you think?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
That makes sense as a stopgap, sure.  One-year deal with an eye towards trading Hoskins to a contender at the deadline.

====================

SPEAKER: Champdo
---
So the Tigers aren’t going to try to upgrade their offense?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s been puzzlingly quiet on the offense front for Detroit.  I get that they don’t want to block their prospects, but that doesn’t mean they couldn’t add at least short-term help.

====================

SPEAKER: Just a question
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, doesn’t a salary cap also cap tax revenue?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Depends on the type of cap.  If it’s a hard cap like the NFL or NHL, there’s no tax involved.  If it’s a soft cap like the NBA with various levels of aprons and whatnot, there will be some tax revenue available.The MLBPA is almost certainly not going to accept any kind of salary cap in the next round of CBA talks.  But, in the very remote chance they did, it would have to be a soft cap that still allows for some level of overages.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
The RedSox are in a world of hurt

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
They’re signing Frank Thomas?!

====================

SPEAKER: C
---
What could the Yankees get if they made JC Escarra available to the Red Sox? Kyle Harrison?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I realize that Harrison hasn’t done a ton yet at the MLB level, but that is an absurd overpay for Escarra

====================

SPEAKER: Warrens baseball
---
Is there a good chance some kind of heavy deterrent to spending at dodgers  levels will be put in place during this upcoming cba?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I suspect there will be some kind of crackdown on deferred money.  The MLBPA might (very big might) be open to that, but more realistically they’ll still view it as an attempt to limit salaries, and they’ll be correct

====================

SPEAKER: Trey
---
Isn’t this a good time for Cards to rebuild – especially with the pontential stoppage

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Last year seemed like an even better team for the Cardinals to rebuild, yet they didn’t.  Notwithstanding how their hands were tied by some no-trade clauses, it still makes me scratch my head about how even guys like Helsley, etc. weren’t dealt. Weren’t dealt last winter, that is

====================

SPEAKER: Kyle
---
Chances Hoerner gets moved this offseason?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Pretty low.  The Cubs aren’t moving him unless they get a huge offer, plus Nico has a no-trade clause Oops, wait, correction, I forgot that he’s one of the few Cubs that didn’t have a NTC in his deal

====================

SPEAKER: Huckleberry
---
Do all these cast-offs the Angels have acquired equate to a competitive baseball teamv

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Nope. Sorry Angels fans, you’re in for another rough year.

====================

SPEAKER: I’m back!
---
Jo Adell for Brett Baty?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ah, a Jo Adell trade question….feels like old times!This deal makes a decent amount of sense for both sides, but I think the Mets want an actual center fielder, not a guy who can play center field but with poor glovework

====================

SPEAKER: Red Sox
---
How high of a ranked prospect will we need to add to trade Yoshida ?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Considering those trades with the Cardinals, I wonder if the timing had worked out better (i.e. if Contreras had been more willing to waive his no-trade clause earlier), if Yoshida could’ve just been dealt to St. Louis as salary offset as part of a package for both Gray and Contreras.  Probably still no, since while the Cards were eating money in the trades anyway, they still wanted players back

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Super Bowl predictions

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
At this point it’s probably foolish to pick anyone but the Patriots, who are having one of the luckiest seasons in the history of sports.

====================

SPEAKER: Former Giants Fan
---
Are they really going to stand Pat and literally do basically nothing to upgrade their roster this year? Tell me they still have a move or 2 coming.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It occurs to me that these chats have had messages like these from Giants fans for the better part of two months now, and I keep writing things like “still plenty of time….”And it’s still true, but y’know, it is January 18 and the Giants still have sizable holes in the outfield and at second base. As I’ve written before, I find it hard to believe that the Giants won’t do SOMETHING noteworthy beyond adding Mahle and Hauser to the rotation.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Bubic to Mets for jet williams

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
No chance Williams is dealt for one season of Bubic.

====================

SPEAKER: Angels
---
It’s obvious halos are not going to spend this off season, is Arte going to sell?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Moreno walked back his past attempts at exploring a sale, but he could revisit things after the next CBA is finalized. Only Moreno knows the question to this question, of course.

====================

SPEAKER: Greg
---
Do you see the Pirates moving Henry Davis or Endy Rodriguez to one of these catcher needy teams?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Endy is the likelier of the two, just because the Pirates might not be able to bring themselves to move a 1-1 player just yet

====================

SPEAKER: Andrew
---
Suppose the owners get their salary cap. What happens to contracts like Ohtani’s, Soto’s, etc? Would they be grandfathered in and the Dodgers and Mets would just be  mostly unable to sign free agents until they come off the books?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As noted earlier, if the MLBPA did somehow agree to any sort of a cap, it would be a soft cap with some sort of luxury tax still attached for overages.  So depending on how stiff the penalties are, the Dodgers/Mets/etc. could decide they don’t really care about the penalties and keep spending big.But, the league would certainly create a year or two of grace period for teams to get under this new cap

====================

SPEAKER: Chip
---
SF Giant suggestion: trade Heliot Ramos and his horrible defense to STL for Donovan. Sign Bellinger and Bader to fix that outfield D, and still stay under the tax. Thoughts?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Ramos probably isn’t the kind of player St. Louis is targeting in Donovan trade talks.

====================

SPEAKER: Ari
---
do you think the rays will sign a catcher or infielder or trade for someone

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Trade seems much more like Tampa’s style

====================

SPEAKER: JRam
---
I don’t really have a question but I think that with the events of this year’s off season baseball should celebrate one of the few non-mercenaries in the sport who stayed with his team because he understood that he can live off of a couple hundred million dollars. Probably the last player to ever do it.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I don’t blame any player for trying to maximize their earning potential, nor do I blame Ramirez for being content in Cleveland and being okay with a below-market deal.I do have to put some blame towards Guardians ownership for having this rare scenario of a superstar-level player on a relative bargain deal, yet still not being particularly aggressive in trying to win during Ramirez’s prime

====================

SPEAKER: Hami
---
Id the Trop going to be ready for the Rays to play in or are they playing at Steinbrenner field again?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Trop is on track to be ready for Opening Day

====================

SPEAKER: Phillies offseason
---
So in other words, the Phillies off-season has not been elite?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
“Ah ha ha!” — Family Guy ostrich voice

====================

SPEAKER: Mark S
---
Noise and impatient fan bases aside when it comes to offseason moves, what is your current power ranking in the NL East and how close/similar are the top teams to each other?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Phillies are the clear #1 and Nationals are the clear #5. In between I’d go Braves, Mets, Marlins in that order, for now.

====================

SPEAKER: Tim
---
Has anyone thanked the Dodgers for the lockout that will wipe out the 2027 season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
A lockout was always happening no matter who’d won the last two World Series

====================

SPEAKER: George Brett
---
What’s up with Jac Caglione? Kid was as highly regarded as they come last year and now he may not even make the opening day roster?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He just wasn’t ready for the majors.  While he was crushing minor league pitching, Caglianone clearly didn’t have enough seasoning yet to adjust to the Show.  Doesn’t mean he can’t or won’t be very good in the future, but counting on him even for 2026 is a risk for the Royals.This is where KC’s failure to upgrade their outfield last offseason cost them.  If they’d brought in at least one good OF last winter, perhaps the Royals don’t feel as much urgency to promote Caglianone so soon.

====================

SPEAKER: Scoots McGoots
---
Why do you think Bassitt hasn’t signed yet?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The offers probably aren’t there yet, for whatever reason.  Maybe he’s not getting anything beyond a one-year guarantee due to his age, or teams are waiting until later in the offseason to bump up their offers if Bassitt is widely viewed as sort of a backup plan rotation option.Speculatively, maybe he’s even waiting to see if the Jays can step up with a late offer, even if fitting him into the 2026 rotation seems tricky.

====================

SPEAKER: Bill
---
I know Hazen said he’s not trading Marte – but hasn’t Marte’s trade market changed in the past week? For instance, why not Duran to NYM, Bello, Baty, Sproat to AZ, and Marte back to Boston? That seems a possibility now that NYM acquired Bichette.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As I noted in the Marte post yesterday, Hazen isn’t hanging up the phone if a team emerges with a truly lopsided offer.  But barring such a Godfather offer (and Bello/Baty/Sproat isn’t it), Marte’s not going anywhere.

====================

SPEAKER: Trading Draft Picks
---
Why is it the MLB does not allow you to trade draft picks when all of the other sports do? In the NHL you are also a few years away as a prospect so why doesn’t MLB let you trade draft picks?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I’ve been beating this drum for years.  You probably would only rarely see top picks actually traded, but it would happen just enough to make the MLB draft a lot spicier.The league is always looking for ways to make the MLB draft more of an event, while overlooking the simple answer of traded picks.

====================

SPEAKER: Bendix
---
On a scale of 1-10 how much do you believe in Marlins youth this upcoming season?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I think Miami is going to be pretty decent.  While I did pick them for fourth in the NL East a few posts up, another third-place finish wouldn’t shock me. And a winning record is definitely possible.

====================

SPEAKER: Rookies
---
Are the Phillies taking too big a risk turning center field over to the rookie Crawford when the aging roster has only so many chances left?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Guys like Kemp, Rojas, and Wilson are still around for OF depth purposes, so Marsh could be moved back into center field if Crawford struggles.  It is a risk on the Phillies’ part, but they’re high on Crawford, and he’s looked awfully good in the minors

====================

SPEAKER: Your Name
---
Seen some Cardinals fans hoping for Marcelo Mayer as part of a Brendan Donovan return. Unrealistic, no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Very

====================

SPEAKER: Garr
---
Luis Robert to KC? They need to upgrade in CF

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Intra-division trade, so that’s one obstacle right there.The issue with Robert is that the White Sox still want to get a noteworthy return for him, while rival teams are understandably wary about giving him too much for a guy who has struggled for the last two years.  And, Robert’s salary would be an issue for a mid-level spender like KC

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Is Cody Bellinger actually good?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Sure, he’s a very good player.  The problem is that Boras is looking for a contract befitting the Dodgers MVP version of Bellinger, and that guy doesn’t appear to be coming back.

====================

SPEAKER: OZ
---
The passing of Wilbur Wood and a glance at his out-of-this-world stats from 1971-1975 should convince some team to try to develop knuckleballers, especially with the rash of Tommy John injuries affecting practically every organization.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
In fairness, Wood was an anomaly even by knuckleballer standards.  And while it would be cool to see more knucklers in the modern game, it’s also a very difficult pitch to learn, let alone master.

====================

SPEAKER: Buster
---
Giants pull a surprise and out of the blue sign Cody B. 6 years at $30. Pipe dream?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
He’d be a great boost to a questionable Giants outfield, but it’s unclear if SF is willing to go to those spending lengths (on anyone, let alone Cody)

====================

SPEAKER: SouthJerseySteve
---
Nick Castellanos (1/$20M) for Tanner Scott (3/$50M). Who says no?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
In just a pure salary dump for LA?  I don’t think the Dodgers are ready to just give up on Scott entirely, nor are in any need to pare salary

====================

SPEAKER: Cutch
---
I still want to finish my career as a Pirate. Am I not worthy anymore?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
It’s tricky because Cutch is such a legend and so beloved in Pittsburgh.  But in terms of what a player can produce in 2026 or how much playing time he should get, it’s tough to argue apart from pure sentiment that McCutchen should be part of a team serious about winning

====================

SPEAKER: Blue
---
Feels like Padres are in a good spot to try and move Cronenworth with Hoerner/Marte both seeming unlikely to move

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Cronenworth’s contract is a huge negative in trade talks.  Hoerner is just for one year and Marte is a superstar, so they both have way more trade value.

====================

SPEAKER: question
---
Correct me if im wrong a no trade clause is where a player can’t get traded unless he agrees?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Correct. Some clauses are for any trade, some players have clauses that allow them to block trades to only a certain number of teams. If a player has 10-and-5 rights (10 years of MLB service time, five consecutive years with the same team), they get automatic no-trade protection

====================

SPEAKER: Belli Button
---
Does Boras really have offers for Bellinger other than the Yankees?  It looks like the Yankees aren’t moving.  Will Bellinger be one of those February signigns like Alonso and Snell?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I suspect this is exactly what the Yankees are thinking — they already have the best offer on the table for Bellinger, and they aren’t budging.

====================

SPEAKER: Trip
---
Is the Kim injury a sign that the Braves injury issues will continue?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Falling on ice and hurting your finger is too much of a fluke to assume the Braves are in for another snake-bitten injury year.Three misfortunes? Sure.  Seven misfortunes?  There’s an outside chance.  But NINE misfortunes?! I’d like to see that!

====================

SPEAKER: Atkins
---
Bichette and Guerrero should have both been Jays for life. The Jays needed to make that happen earlier in their careers. Also extend Barger

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
As the sons of wealthy ballplayers, Bichette and Guerrero had the financial comfort to bet on themselves early in their careers, rather than seek out an extension.  Also, their play was just inconsistent enough from year to year that it’s understandable why the Jays weren’t totally comfortable breaking the bank for either until extending Vlad last spring. It seems very likely that Toronto will be exploring an extension with Barger this spring, if they haven’t already

====================

SPEAKER: Bill
---
Would the Phillies be interested in Yoshida for Castellanos?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Yoshida doesn’t have any real utility in Philly with Schwarber locked into the DH spot.  Yoshida is a part-time left fielder at best.

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
Hoyer said at Cubs Con that they weren’t done yet. Bellinger?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
To be fair, it would’ve been pretty unlikely to see Hoyer stand up in front of a crowd of Cubs fans and announce “that’s it! I’m going on vacation!” and then run offstage with an overstuffed suitcase.

====================

SPEAKER: Tyler
---
As a Reds fan I wouldn’t be on board with this, but I’ve seen multiple fellow Reds fans recommend dealing Brady Singer and Tyler Stephenson for Jarren Duran. Is that something Boston would even consider? Feels very light to me when you consider years of control and Duran’s ceiling.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Boston definitely wants a lot more than that for Duran

====================

SPEAKER: Guest
---
What offers could Xander Bogaerts expect if he were a free agent today?  How much $ for how many years?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Entering his age-33 season, coming off 5.2 fWAR and an exact 100 wRC+ offensive performance over the 2024-25 seasons, mixed reviews on his defense but best served as a second baseman at this point….I can see a two-year contract based on track record, at maybe something like $18MM total? “What would this guy make if he was a free agent now?” is a fantastic way of gauging current value, btw

====================

SPEAKER: Oakland
---
I see many similarities between the Oakland situation and Washington’s struggle to get back in the game.

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
The Nats aren’t in any danger of moving, nor is their ballpark (which is very nice, I’ve been there in person) any sort of detriment.  Don’t forget, the A’s were a winning team as recently as 2021, so their rebuild is already coming along way better in a shorter timespan than Washington’s, despite numerous more obstacles

====================

SPEAKER: Michael
---
What makes you think Gore’s such a near-lock to stand pat this winter? Imagine an analytically driven FO like Toboni and co would want to capitalize now/avoid risk of injury? Gore’s already shown multiple times he can put up a big first half. What’s doing that again going to accomplish?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
My stance has been that Toboni will take some time to retool the front office and evaluate things before really making a lot of big roster decisions, i.e. “should we reboot the rebuild, or try to build on what we already have?”If another team steps up with a big enough offer, Gore will indeed be moved this winter.  But, given how the Nats are asking for a haul in return, it remains to be seen if any rival clubs will meet that price.  Admittedly, the whole situation is hard to access because Toboni is a first-time PBO, so we have no idea about how he’ll operate

====================

SPEAKER: Balloon Man Dan
---
How close to 100% are the tigers to trading Skubal at the deadline?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Not if the team is winning the Central or contending for a playoff berth

====================

SPEAKER: Bernie Brewer
---
Andrew Vaughn is a free agent after this season. Do you think the brewers resign him or let him walk?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
Probably let him walk.  The Brewers aren’t likely to spend a significant amount on the first base position.

====================

SPEAKER: Sid the Kid
---
With a few hall of fame careers winding down, where does Jr Griffey place on your top 10-15 of all time list?

====================

SPEAKER: Mark P
---
I wouldn’t have Griffey in my top 10-15, but he’s not far outside that range We’re well over two hours now, so I should wrap things up.  Thanks so much for all the activity tonight….it was so busy that there’s still a full page of questions and comments I didn’t get to, because of the jam-packed queue.  The participation is very much appreciated! fyi, if you’re interested in more baseball Q&A, one of the many benefits of our Trade Rumors Front Office subscription is the exclusive weekly live chats.
