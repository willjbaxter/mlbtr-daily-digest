Good afternoon! I'll get this going in a couple hours, but feel free to submit questions ahead of time, as always. Hello there! Let's get underway

====================

SPEAKER: Mariners
---
Mariners have announced starters for games 3 and 4 already, and woo is not among them. Do you think he appears in the ALCS at all?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
Adam Jude with the Seattle Times reported a bit ago that they're targeting a Game 5 start for Woo, so as long as the M's don't sweep, yeah I expect to see him.

Should the Padres trade Pivetta for prospects and use that money to sign King longterm

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
This might've felt more plausible if King had repeated his 2024 season, but his earning power was crushed pretty heavily by all the health struggles this year. I think they can probably find a way to try to keep him on a creative deal like the ones president AJ Preller has dreamt up with Robert Suarez, Nick Martinez and Pivetta himself. The Padres are pretty good at manipulating player options and back/front-loading contracts to mitigate the CBT hit but do so with a notable guarantee and a crack at returning to free agency early for the player in question.And really, because of that, I doubt Pivetta has the value many would see upon first glance at his numbers. He can opt back into free agency next season.Pivetta  was only paid $4MM this year. He's still guaranteed $51MM over three years, with $19MM of that paid out in 2026. Any team trading for him knows that if he pitches like he did in '25, he's opting out, effectively rendering him a one-year rental. If he struggles or suffers a major injury, they're on the hook for $51MM guaranteed. As with all player option/opt-out contracts, there's just far more downside than there is upside.

I know Alonso wants a 7 year deal, but those long term deals are just not popular with teams anymore. And I think itâ€™s even less likely for a power hitting first baseman. Could something like a 4 year/$180 million deal with a 5 year player option do it for Alonso?

====================

SPEAKER: Steve Adams
---
I don't think Alonso has any delusions of signing a 7-year deal this winter, and I don't think any team in its right mind would do 4/180. We're going to end up predicting some $60-70MM less than that on our top 50 I don't think Alonso has any delusions of signing a 7-year deal this winter, and I don't think any team in its right mind would do 4/180.
