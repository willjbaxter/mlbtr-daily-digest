Through June 1st, Tucker boasted a 157 wRC+ in 370 PAs, rivaling Shohei Ohtani and Pete Crow-Armstrong with ~4 WAR and placing him in the NL MVP conversation.  However, a hairline fracture in his right ring finger, sustained on June 1st and only diagnosed a week or two later, significantly impacted his power production. While he posted a 173 wRC+ in June, his home run output plummeted after June 28th (one HR in the next 172 PAs), coinciding with a potential swing adjustment due to the injury.  His frustration manifested in on-field displays (throwing helmet, bat slams, not running out grounders) leading to fan boos and a mid-August benching for a &quot;mental reset&quot; by manager Craig Counsell.  The injury&#x27;s revelation came unexpectedly from Brewers manager Pat Murphy on August 19th, raising questions about the Cubs&#x27; communication and handling of the situation.</li><li class="insight priority">**Kyle Tucker&#x27;s Injury Timeline and Impact:**  A June 1st right ring finger hairline fracture, undiagnosed for approximately one to two weeks, significantly impacted Kyle Tucker&#x27;s performance.  While initially maintaining a high level of play (173 wRC+ in June), a noticeable power drop occurred four weeks post-injury (one home run in 172 PAs after June 28th). This suggests a potential swing adjustment due to the injury, impacting his overall production and leading to visible frustration.  The delayed diagnosis and the unusual revelation by Brewers manager Pat Murphy on August 19th highlight communication issues within the Cubs organization.</li><li class="insight">**Nick Lodolo Trade Speculation (Reds):**  The Cincinnati Reds are rumored to be considering trading Nick Lodolo this winter for a significant offensive upgrade.

NE asks: Do the Cubs and Kyle Tucker have any interest in an extension? Tucker came out of the gates with a 157 wRC+ in 370 plate appearances through June.  That performance put him basically in a dead heat with fellow All-Star starter Pete Crow-Armstrong and Shohei Ohtani with 4 WAR, at which point all three players were in the NL MVP race. Tucker jammed his right ring finger on a June 1st slide.  He continued to play well, but later revealed that &quot;a week or two after that&quot; x-rays found a hairline fracture.  The narrative around the injury remains confusing. Tucker posted a 173 wRC+ in June, the best month of his season.  He homered on June 28th as part of a four-hit game.  Then he went on to hit just one home run over his next 172 PA.  So the idea is that Tucker played through this injury but it only began to sap his power four weeks later, perhaps due to some mechanical change to his swing. By mid-August, Tucker was throwing his helmet, slamming his bat, failing to run out grounders, and getting booed by Cubs fans. On August 18th , Cubs manager Craig Counsell announced the plan to give Tucker a mental reset on the bench.  The following day, Brewers manager Pat Murphy went on 670 The Score and said, &quot;I think Tucker is hurt. I don&#x27;t have any information, but Tucker&#x27;s not the same. He&#x27;s hurt, and he&#x27;s playing through it. He&#x27;s such a class kid that he probably doesn&#x27;t mention it to anyone.&quot; Murphy&#x27;s comments caused the Cubs to fess up to Tucker playing through the hairline fracture.  It was just a very odd way for this to all go down: the injury that didn&#x27;t manifest itself for four weeks, and the reveal coming from a rival team&#x27;s manager who either made a really good guess or actually did have some information.</p>
