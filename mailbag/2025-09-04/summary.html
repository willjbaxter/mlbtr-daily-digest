Colin asks: Where are some realistic landing spots for Kyle Tucker this offseason? Why not just assess the viability of Tucker for all 30 teams?  I&#x27;m sure Tucker&#x27;s agents at Excel Sports Management already have. White Sox : In their June statement , the team said that Justin Ishbia &quot;will make capital infusions into the White Sox as a limited partner in 2025 and 2026 that will be used to pay down existing debt and support ongoing team operations.&quot;  The team&#x27;s long-term books are already clean.  Could Ishbia announce his presence by signing Tucker to a contract worth perhaps more than six times the team&#x27;s current record deal of $75MM? Chalk it up as highly unlikely, yet still more likely than it&#x27;s been in a long time. Guardians : No chance. Tigers : The club&#x27;s dalliance with Alex Bregman last winter was notable, but that still wouldn&#x27;t have been a top-three free agent deal.  Tucker is highly unlikely here based on how the Tigers have operated since Mike Ilitch passed away in 2017. Royals : No chance. Twins : No chance. Orioles : Payroll-wise, the Orioles could manage this, but we&#x27;ve been saying that sort of thing for a while now.  We&#x27;ve only seen one offseason under David Rubenstein, and it topped out with Tyler O&#x27;Neill &#x27;s $49.5MM deal, but he could theoretically surprise us. Red Sox : On a team with Jarren Duran , Ceddanne Rafaela , Roman Anthony , and Wilyer Abreu , signing Tucker doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense.  The Red Sox were in on Juan Soto last winter, and Duran or Abreu could be traded, so we won&#x27;t rule it out quite yet. Yankees : With Trent Grisham and Cody Bellinger up for free agency and Jasson Dominguez failing to assert himself, there is a reasonable case to be made here for Tucker.  There&#x27;s enough payroll space to make it work as well. Rays : I was going to write &quot;no chance&quot; and move on, but Tucker is from Tampa and Patrick Zalupski should assume ownership of the Rays before the outfielder signs.  Given that Zalupski can&#x27;t magically change the Rays&#x27; market size, he doesn&#x27;t have a plan for a new stadium in place, and he doesn&#x27;t have Steve Cohen type net worth, this is still pretty close to &quot;no chance.&quot; Blue Jays : Nathan Lukes , Daulton Varsho , and Addison Barger make up a typical Jays outfield right now, with George Springer , Myles Straw , and Davis Schneider also drawing some starts and Anthony Santander on the IL.  Re-signing Bo Bichette or adding starting pitching would seem more urgent, but there&#x27;s no particular impediment to the Blue Jays pursuing Tucker.  Plus, Excel did the Springer deal with the Blue Jays. Athletics : The A&#x27;s made their statement last winter with a trio of $60-something million contracts ( Luis Severino , Lawrence Butler , and Brent Rooker ).  That&#x27;s still a very far cry from Tucker&#x27;s stratosphere, and he&#x27;s not going to elect to make Sutter Health Park his new home for the next few years. Astros : There&#x27;s no evidence the Astros got anywhere with extension talks when they had Tucker, and no reason to think Jim Crane will break precedent and give him a huge contract on the open market. Angels : With Anthony Rendon &#x27;s contract almost off the books, could the Angels try for a major free agent once again?  There&#x27;s no compelling reason to think so, but Arte Moreno is at least capable of swimming in these waters. Mariners : The Robinson Cano deal happened nearly 12 years ago; the Mariners would likely have to similarly bowl over the competition to convince Tucker to come there.  Consider it unlikely, but not absurd. Rangers : The Rangers are on track to stay under the CBT and thus reset their payor status.  Adding a fourth huge contract running into a player&#x27;s late 30s might not be the best long-term move, and starting pitching seems more urgent, but a pursuit of Tucker can&#x27;t be ruled out. Moving on to the National League:</p>
